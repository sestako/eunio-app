# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds unit system preferences to the Eunio health tracking application, allowing users to choose between metric and imperial measurement systems. The feature ensures consistent display of measurements throughout the app while maintaining user preferences across sessions and platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unit System Selection Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select my preferred unit system in the app settings, so that all measurements are displayed in units I'm familiar with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the settings screen THEN the system SHALL display a unit system preference option
2. WHEN a user views the unit system setting THEN the system SHALL show options for Metric and Imperial systems
3. WHEN a user selects Metric THEN the system SHALL use kilometers, kilograms, and Celsius for measurements
4. WHEN a user selects Imperial THEN the system SHALL use miles, pounds, and Fahrenheit for measurements
5. WHEN a user changes the unit system THEN the system SHALL immediately update all displayed measurements

### Requirement 2: Preference Persistence and Offline Sync

**User Story:** As a user, I want my unit system preference to be remembered across app sessions and synced across devices, so that I don't have to reconfigure it every time I use the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a unit system THEN the system SHALL save the preference to local storage
2. WHEN a user restarts the app THEN the system SHALL load and apply the previously selected unit system
3. WHEN a user is signed in THEN the system SHALL sync the unit preference to their cloud profile
4. WHEN a user signs in on a new device THEN the system SHALL restore their unit system preference from the cloud
5. WHEN a user changes unit preference while offline THEN the system SHALL store the change locally and sync when connectivity is restored
6. IF no preference is stored THEN the system SHALL apply the default unit system based on locale

### Requirement 3: Global Measurement Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want all measurements in the app to automatically display in my chosen unit system, so that I have a consistent experience throughout the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying weight measurements THEN the system SHALL show values in kg (metric) or lbs (imperial)
2. WHEN displaying distance measurements THEN the system SHALL show values in km (metric) or miles (imperial)
3. WHEN displaying temperature measurements THEN the system SHALL show values in °C (metric) or °F (imperial)
4. WHEN the user changes unit preference THEN the system SHALL update all visible measurements immediately
5. WHEN entering new measurements THEN the system SHALL accept input in the selected unit system

### Requirement 4: Unit Conversion Logic and Data Storage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust conversion functions between metric and imperial units, so that data can be stored consistently while displayed in user-preferred units.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting weight THEN the system SHALL use the formula: kg = lbs / 2.20462
2. WHEN converting distance THEN the system SHALL use the formula: km = miles / 0.621371
3. WHEN converting temperature THEN the system SHALL use the formula: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
4. WHEN performing conversions THEN the system SHALL round using round half up to 2 decimal places for display
5. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL always use metric units internally regardless of user preference
6. WHEN displaying historical data THEN the system SHALL convert from stored metric values to user preference without modifying the original data
7. WHEN user changes unit preference THEN the system SHALL NOT convert or rewrite existing database records

### Requirement 5: Locale-Based Default Selection

**User Story:** As a new user, I want the app to intelligently default to the unit system commonly used in my region, so that I don't need to manually configure it if the default is appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user first opens the app THEN the system SHALL detect the device locale
2. WHEN the locale indicates US, Liberia, or Myanmar THEN the system SHALL default to Imperial units
3. WHEN the locale indicates any other country THEN the system SHALL default to Metric units
4. WHEN the user manually changes the unit system THEN the system SHALL override the locale-based default permanently
5. WHEN the device locale changes after initial setup THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's manually chosen preference
6. IF locale detection fails THEN the system SHALL default to Metric units

### Requirement 6: Settings Integration and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want the unit system preference to be easily accessible in the app settings with clear feedback when I make changes, so that I can confidently manage my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing app settings THEN the system SHALL display a "Unit System" section
2. WHEN viewing the unit system setting THEN the system SHALL show the currently selected option
3. WHEN the setting is displayed THEN the system SHALL include descriptions of what each option includes
4. WHEN changing the setting THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
5. WHEN the setting is changed THEN the system SHALL display a non-intrusive confirmation message (toast/snackbar)
6. WHEN the confirmation message is shown THEN the system SHALL indicate that the change was applied successfully

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Consistency

**User Story:** As a user with multiple devices, I want my unit system preference to work consistently across Android and iOS platforms, so that my experience is seamless regardless of which device I use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Android app THEN the system SHALL display and function identically to the iOS version
2. WHEN syncing preferences THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all user devices
3. WHEN platform-specific storage is used THEN the system SHALL ensure data compatibility between platforms
4. WHEN displaying measurements THEN the system SHALL use identical formatting and precision on both platforms
5. WHEN converting units THEN the system SHALL produce identical results on both Android and iOS

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for unit conversion and preference management, so that the feature works reliably across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit conversion functions are tested THEN the system SHALL validate accuracy for all supported conversions
2. WHEN preference persistence is tested THEN the system SHALL verify storage and retrieval across app restarts
3. WHEN UI updates are tested THEN the system SHALL confirm immediate reflection of preference changes
4. WHEN integration is tested THEN the system SHALL validate end-to-end functionality from settings to display
5. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN the system SHALL handle invalid inputs and network failures gracefully
