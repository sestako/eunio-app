# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Settings feature transforms the existing basic settings structure in the Eunio Health App into a comprehensive, functional settings system. This feature connects user preferences to the app's functionality, providing personalized configuration options for health tracking, notifications, privacy, and user experience. The enhanced settings will integrate with the existing Firebase backend and shared Kotlin Multiplatform architecture to ensure consistent behavior across iOS and Android platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unit System Preferences

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my preferred unit system for temperature and weight measurements, so that all health data is displayed in units I'm familiar with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Units settings THEN the system SHALL display options for temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit) and weight units (kg/lbs)
2. WHEN a user changes unit preferences THEN the system SHALL immediately update all measurement displays throughout the app
3. WHEN unit preferences are changed THEN the system SHALL save the preferences to both local storage and Firebase user profile
4. IF the app is offline WHEN preferences are changed THEN the system SHALL save locally and sync when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 2: Notification Preferences

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my notification settings for period reminders, ovulation alerts, and daily logging prompts, so that I receive relevant notifications at appropriate times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses notification settings THEN the system SHALL display toggles for daily logging reminders, period predictions, ovulation alerts, and insight notifications
2. WHEN a user enables daily logging reminders THEN the system SHALL allow time selection and save the preference
3. WHEN notification preferences are changed THEN the system SHALL update local notification scheduling immediately
4. WHEN a user disables all notifications THEN the system SHALL cancel all scheduled notifications and update the user profile

### Requirement 3: Cycle Configuration Settings

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my cycle tracking parameters like average cycle length and luteal phase length, so that predictions are more accurate for my body.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses cycle settings THEN the system SHALL display inputs for average cycle length (21-45 days) and average luteal phase length (10-16 days)
2. WHEN cycle parameters are updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate future predictions using the new parameters
3. WHEN invalid cycle parameters are entered THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent saving
4. WHEN cycle settings are saved THEN the system SHALL update the user profile in Firebase and trigger prediction recalculation

### Requirement 4: Privacy and Data Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control my data sharing preferences and understand how my health data is protected, so that I can make informed decisions about my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses privacy settings THEN the system SHALL display data sharing preferences, data export options, and privacy policy access
2. WHEN a user disables data sharing for insights THEN the system SHALL exclude their anonymized data from pattern analysis
3. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive data export file within 24 hours
4. WHEN a user requests account deletion THEN the system SHALL provide a secure deletion process with confirmation steps

### Requirement 5: Data Synchronization Settings

**User Story:** As a user with multiple devices, I want to control how my data syncs across devices and manage cloud backup preferences, so that I can access my data reliably while controlling storage usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses sync settings THEN the system SHALL display sync status, last sync time, and backup preferences
2. WHEN a user enables automatic sync THEN the system SHALL sync data changes within 30 seconds when connected to WiFi
3. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL present conflict resolution options to the user
4. WHEN a user disables cloud backup THEN the system SHALL warn about data loss risks and require confirmation

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and Display Preferences

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to customize display settings like text size, color contrast, and haptic feedback, so that the app is comfortable and usable for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses display settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for text size scaling, high contrast mode, and haptic feedback intensity
2. WHEN display preferences are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately throughout the app
3. WHEN high contrast mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL use accessibility-compliant color combinations
4. WHEN haptic feedback is disabled THEN the system SHALL remove all vibration feedback from user interactions

### Requirement 7: Help and Support Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want easy access to help resources, FAQ, and support contact options, so that I can get assistance when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses help settings THEN the system SHALL display FAQ categories, tutorial access, and contact support options
2. WHEN a user selects a FAQ category THEN the system SHALL display relevant questions and answers with search functionality
3. WHEN a user contacts support THEN the system SHALL pre-populate device information and app version for efficient troubleshooting
4. WHEN a user reports a bug THEN the system SHALL optionally include anonymized usage logs to assist with diagnosis

### Requirement 8: Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information including name, email, and health goals, so that I can keep my account information current and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses profile settings THEN the system SHALL display editable fields for name, email, and primary health goal
2. WHEN profile information is updated THEN the system SHALL validate the changes and save to Firebase Authentication and Firestore
3. WHEN email is changed THEN the system SHALL require email verification before updating the account
4. WHEN health goals are modified THEN the system SHALL update insight generation parameters to match new goals

### Requirement 9: Settings Search and Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly find specific settings through search and logical organization, so that I can efficiently configure the app without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the main settings screen THEN the system SHALL display settings organized in logical sections with clear icons and descriptions
2. WHEN a user uses the settings search THEN the system SHALL filter settings options based on keywords and display relevant matches
3. WHEN a user frequently accesses certain settings THEN the system SHALL optionally display recently used settings at the top
4. WHEN settings have dependencies THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate relationships and disable dependent options when appropriate

### Requirement 10: Settings Backup and Restore

**User Story:** As a user switching devices or reinstalling the app, I want my settings preferences to be automatically restored, so that I don't have to reconfigure everything manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in on a new device THEN the system SHALL automatically restore all settings preferences from their Firebase profile
2. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL backup preferences to Firebase within 5 seconds
3. WHEN a user has conflicting settings between devices THEN the system SHALL use the most recently modified settings as the source of truth
4. WHEN settings backup fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and notify the user if persistent failures occur
