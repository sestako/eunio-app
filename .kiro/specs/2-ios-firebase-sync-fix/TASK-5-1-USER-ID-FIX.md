# Task 5.1 - User ID Fix Applied

## Problem Identified
The iOS save operation was failing because the Kotlin code couldn't access the Firebase user ID.

### Root Cause
- Swift Firebase authentication stores user ID in UserDefaults with key "currentUserId"
- Kotlin iOS AuthService was using a mock implementation that didn't read from UserDefaults
- When saving daily logs, the Kotlin code had no valid user ID

### Evidence
- User created log for October 15, 2025 with note "ios test"
- Log did NOT appear in Firebase
- Only old logs from October 25, 2025 were visible in Firebase

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made
Updated `shared/src/iosMain/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/data/remote/auth/IOSAuthService.kt`:

1. **Added UserDefaults import**:
   ```kotlin
   import platform.Foundation.NSUserDefaults
   ```

2. **Updated `getCurrentUser()` method** to read from UserDefaults:
   ```kotlin
   override suspend fun getCurrentUser(): Result<User?> {
       // Try to get user from UserDefaults (set by Swift Firebase layer)
       val userDefaults = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults
       val userId = userDefaults.stringForKey("currentUserId")
       val userEmail = userDefaults.stringForKey("currentUserEmail")
       val userName = userDefaults.stringForKey("currentUserName")
       
       if (userId != null && userEmail != null) {
           // Create user from UserDefaults data
           val now = Clock.System.now()
           val user = User(
               id = userId,
               email = userEmail,
               name = userName ?: userEmail,
               onboardingComplete = true,
               primaryGoal = HealthGoal.GENERAL_HEALTH,
               createdAt = now,
               updatedAt = now
           )
           currentUser = user
           return Result.success(user)
       }
       
       // Fall back to mock user if available
       return Result.success(currentUser)
   }
   ```

### How It Works
1. Swift Firebase authentication stores user info in UserDefaults when user signs in
2. Kotlin code now reads this info using `NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults`
3. Creates a proper User object with the real Firebase user ID
4. Daily log saves now use the correct user ID path in Firestore

## Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild iOS App in Xcode
The Kotlin framework has been rebuilt with the fix. Now rebuild the iOS app:
1. Open Xcode
2. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. Build the app (Cmd+B)
4. Run on simulator

### 2. Test Save Operation
1. Sign in to the app
2. Create a new daily log for today (October 15, 2025)
3. Add note "ios test fix"
4. Tap "Save Daily Log"
5. Check Xcode console for logs starting with "ðŸ”¥" or "SAVE_DAILY_LOG"
6. Check Firebase Console for the new log

### 3. Verify in Firebase
Look for a log with:
- Date: 20363 (October 15, 2025)
- Note: "ios test fix"
- Path: `users/{your-firebase-user-id}/dailyLogs/{log-id}`

## Expected Behavior
After this fix:
- âœ… Kotlin code can access the real Firebase user ID
- âœ… Daily logs save to the correct Firestore path
- âœ… Logs appear in Firebase Console immediately after saving
- âœ… User ID matches the authenticated Firebase user

## Troubleshooting
If the save still doesn't work, check:
1. User is properly signed in (check UserDefaults has "currentUserId")
2. Firebase bridge is initialized (check for "ðŸ”¥ AppDelegate" logs)
3. No errors in Xcode console when saving
4. Network connectivity is working
