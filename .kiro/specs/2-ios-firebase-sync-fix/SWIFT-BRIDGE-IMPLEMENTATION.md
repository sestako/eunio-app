# Swift Bridge Implementation - Final Solution

## Overview
We'll use the existing Swift `FirebaseIOSBridge` and make the Kotlin side actually call it properly.

## What We Have
1. ✅ `FirebaseIOSBridge.swift` - Swift class with all Firebase methods
2. ✅ `FirebaseBridgeWrapper.swift` - Simplified wrapper for Kotlin interop
3. ✅ Bridge initialization in `iOSApp.swift`
4. ✅ `FirebaseNativeBridge.ios.kt` - Kotlin bridge (currently has TODOs)

## The Solution
Since we can't use CocoaPods cinterop with Xcode 26, we'll:
1. Keep the Swift bridge as-is
2. Revert `FirestoreServiceImpl.ios.kt` to use the bridge
3. Fix `FirebaseNativeBridge.ios.kt` to actually call Swift methods
4. Use a simple callback-based approach

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Revert FirestoreServiceImpl.ios.kt
Go back to the version that uses `FirebaseNativeBridge()` instead of direct Firebase SDK calls.

### Step 2: Fix FirebaseNativeBridge.ios.kt
The key insight: We already have the Swift bridge set via `setSwiftBridge()`. We just need to call its methods.

Since the bridge is stored as `Any`, we can't call methods directly. But we can use a workaround:
- Create a simple protocol/interface
- Cast the bridge to that type
- Call the methods

### Step 3: Test and Verify
Once implemented, test that:
- Saves actually reach Firebase
- Loads work correctly
- Data format is consistent

## Time Estimate
- 2-3 hours to implement
- 1 hour to test
- Total: 3-4 hours

This gets you unblocked today with Xcode 26!
