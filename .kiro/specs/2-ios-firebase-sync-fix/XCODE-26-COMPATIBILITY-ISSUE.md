# Xcode 26 / iOS 18 SDK Compatibility Issue

## The Problem

Kotlin/Native's cinterop tool cannot process the iOS 18 SDK headers in Xcode 26. This affects CocoaPods integration with Firebase.

### Error Message
```
error: module '_c_standard_library_obsolete' requires feature 'found_incompatible_headers__check_search_paths'
error: unknown type name 'ptrdiff_t'
error: unknown type name 'size_t'
error: unknown type name 'wchar_t'
```

## Kotlin Version Compatibility

| Kotlin Version | Xcode 26 Support | Compose 1.5.11 | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| 1.9.21 (current) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Current version, cinterop fails |
| 1.9.22 | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Still has cinterop issues |
| 1.9.23 | ❌ No | ❌ No | Compose incompatible |
| 2.0.0 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Requires Compose plugin migration |

## Solutions

### Option A: Upgrade to Kotlin 2.0 (COMPLEX)
**Time: 2-3 days**

Steps:
1. Upgrade Kotlin to 2.0.0
2. Upgrade Compose Multiplatform to 1.6.11
3. Add new Compose compiler plugin
4. Migrate all `kotlinOptions` to `compilerOptions`
5. Test entire Android app
6. Test entire iOS app
7. Fix any breaking changes

**Pros:**
- ✅ Proper long-term solution
- ✅ Latest Kotlin features
- ✅ Xcode 26 support

**Cons:**
- ❌ Major upgrade, high risk
- ❌ Requires extensive testing
- ❌ May break existing code
- ❌ Takes 2-3 days

### Option B: Use Xcode 15 (TEMPORARY)
**Time: 30 minutes**

Steps:
1. Install Xcode 15.4
2. Switch to it: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-15.4.app`
3. Build with CocoaPods
4. Works with current Kotlin 1.9.21

**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick solution
- ✅ No code changes
- ✅ CocoaPods works

**Cons:**
- ❌ Can't use iOS 18 features
- ❌ Temporary workaround
- ❌ Need to manage multiple Xcode versions

### Option C: Fix Swift Bridge (PRAGMATIC) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Time: 3-4 hours**

Steps:
1. Keep current Kotlin 1.9.21
2. Keep current Xcode 26
3. Fix the existing Swift bridge to actually call Firebase
4. Use proper Objective-C runtime invocation
5. Test and verify

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works with current setup
- ✅ No major upgrades needed
- ✅ Can be done today
- ✅ Low risk

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not the "pure" KMM approach
- ❌ Requires Swift bridge layer

### Option D: Wait for Kotlin 2.0.20+ (FUTURE)
**Time: Unknown**

Wait for a stable Kotlin 2.0.x release that's fully compatible with Compose Multiplatform and has all Xcode 26 fixes.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Most stable solution
- ✅ All issues resolved

**Cons:**
- ❌ Blocks development
- ❌ Unknown timeline
- ❌ Not practical

## My Strong Recommendation

**Go with Option C** - Fix the Swift Bridge

### Why?
1. **Unblocks you immediately** - Can be done in a few hours
2. **Low risk** - No major version upgrades
3. **Works with current tooling** - Xcode 26, Kotlin 1.9.21
4. **Proven pattern** - Many KMM projects use Swift bridges
5. **Can migrate later** - When Kotlin 2.0 ecosystem stabilizes

### Implementation Plan for Option C

1. **Keep the Swift `FirebaseIOSBridge` class** (already exists)
2. **Create a simple Kotlin interface** for the bridge methods
3. **Use Objective-C runtime** to call Swift methods from Kotlin
4. **Add proper error handling** and logging
5. **Test thoroughly**

This gives you a working solution today, and you can migrate to pure CocoaPods later when the ecosystem catches up.

## Decision Time

Which option do you want to proceed with?

- **Option A**: Kotlin 2.0 upgrade (2-3 days, high risk)
- **Option B**: Xcode 15 downgrade (30 min, temporary)
- **Option C**: Fix Swift bridge (3-4 hours, pragmatic) ⭐
- **Option D**: Wait (blocks development)

I strongly recommend **Option C** as the pragmatic path forward.
