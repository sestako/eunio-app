# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive functionality audit of the Eunio Health App. The audit has revealed that while the project has extensive architectural planning and code structure, many core functionalities are incomplete, non-functional, or exist only as placeholder implementations. The app currently cannot function as a complete product due to missing dependency injection initialization, incomplete UI implementations, and disconnected business logic.

## Terminology and Classification Standards

**Functionality Classification:**
- **Non-Functional**: <20% implementation (basic structure only, no working functionality)
- **Partially Implemented**: 20-79% implementation (some working features, missing critical components)
- **Complete**: â‰¥80% implementation (fully functional with minor gaps)

**Review Roles:**
- **QA reviewer**: The person or automated system conducting the functionality audit and assessment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Infrastructure Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all infrastructure issues that prevent the app from functioning, so that I can prioritize fixes for basic app operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the dependency injection setup THEN the QA reviewer SHALL identify that Koin initialization is commented out and not functional
2. WHEN examining the iOS app entry point THEN the QA reviewer SHALL confirm that shared module dependencies are not accessible
3. WHEN reviewing the shared module connection THEN the QA reviewer SHALL verify that ViewModels and Use Cases cannot be instantiated
4. WHEN checking platform-specific implementations THEN the QA reviewer SHALL identify missing concrete implementations for interfaces (minimum 15 missing implementations)
5. WHEN analyzing the authentication flow THEN the QA reviewer SHALL confirm that Firebase/Auth services are not properly configured (0% of auth services functional)

### Requirement 2: User Interface Functionality Assessment

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI elements and buttons to be functional, so that I can actually use the app features as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the Settings screen THEN the QA reviewer SHALL identify that 90% of settings items are non-clickable placeholders
2. WHEN reviewing the Daily Logging screen THEN the QA reviewer SHALL confirm that only basic date selection works (5% functionality)
3. WHEN analyzing the Calendar view THEN the QA reviewer SHALL verify that 100% of data display is from mock data only
4. WHEN checking the Insights screen THEN the QA reviewer SHALL confirm that charts and analytics are placeholder implementations (0% real data processing)
5. WHEN testing authentication screens THEN the QA reviewer SHALL identify that sign-in/sign-up processes are not connected to actual services (UI only, 0% backend functionality)
6. WHEN reviewing navigation flows THEN the QA reviewer SHALL confirm that at least 70% of navigation paths lead to empty or non-functional screens

### Requirement 3: Business Logic Implementation Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all business logic is properly implemented and connected, so that the app can perform its core health tracking functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining Use Cases THEN the QA reviewer SHALL confirm that they exist but cannot be instantiated due to missing dependencies (19 Use Cases identified, 0% functional)
2. WHEN reviewing Repository implementations THEN the QA reviewer SHALL identify that they depend on unimplemented services (10 repositories exist, 0% have working data sources)
3. WHEN analyzing ViewModels THEN the QA reviewer SHALL verify that they cannot access shared business logic (19 ViewModels exist, 0% connected to business layer)
4. WHEN checking data persistence THEN the QA reviewer SHALL confirm that local database operations are not functional (SQLDelight schema exists, 0% operational)
5. WHEN reviewing sync functionality THEN the QA reviewer SHALL identify that cloud synchronization is not implemented (sync interfaces exist, 0% implementation)
