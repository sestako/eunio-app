# Test Sync NOW - After Rebuild

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ iOS now uses REAL Firebase (not mock storage)
2. ✅ iOS and Android use SAME Firebase collection paths
3. ✅ Both platforms fetch from Firebase first

## Rebuild iOS

**IMPORTANT: You MUST rebuild iOS for changes to take effect**

```bash
# In Xcode:
# Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
# Product → Build (Cmd+B)
```

## Quick Test (1 minute)

### Test 1: iOS → Android Sync

1. **iOS:** Save log
   - Date: October 10, 2025
   - Notes: "iOS REAL Firebase Test"
   - Click Save

2. **Android:** Open same date
   - Date: October 10, 2025
   - **Expected:** Should see "iOS REAL Firebase Test" ✅

### Test 2: Android → iOS Sync

1. **Android:** Save log
   - Date: October 11, 2025
   - Notes: "Android Test"
   - Click Save

2. **iOS:** Open same date
   - Date: October 11, 2025
   - **Expected:** Should see "Android Test" ✅

## What Changed

### Before (Broken)
```
iOS → Mock Storage (memory only) ❌
Android → Firebase ✅
Result: No sync ❌
```

### After (Fixed)
```
iOS → Firebase (users/{userId}/dailyLogs) ✅
Android → Firebase (users/{userId}/dailyLogs) ✅
Result: Sync works! ✅
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check you rebuilt iOS
2. Check same user account on both
3. Check Firebase Console:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Look for `users/{userId}/dailyLogs`
   - Verify documents exist

**Status:** Ready to test after iOS rebuild  
**Expected:** Sync should work now!
