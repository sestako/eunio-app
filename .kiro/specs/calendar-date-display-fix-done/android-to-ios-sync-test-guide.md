# Android to iOS Sync Test Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing cross-platform Firebase sync between Android and iOS for the calendar date display fix. The test verifies that daily logs created on Android sync correctly to iOS with the correct dates and data integrity.

**Test Requirements:** 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6

## Prerequisites

### Required Setup

1. **Android Device/Emulator**
   - Android Studio installed
   - Android device or emulator running
   - App installed and authenticated

2. **iOS Device/Simulator**
   - Xcode installed
   - iOS device or simulator running
   - App installed and authenticated

3. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Both apps connected to the same Firebase project
   - Firestore database accessible
   - Authentication enabled
   - Internet connection on both devices

4. **User Account**
   - Same user account logged in on both Android and iOS
   - User must be authenticated before running tests

## Test Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Android Test Execution

#### Step 1: Run Android Sync Tests

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/Eunio-app

# Run Android instrumentation tests
./gradlew :androidApp:connectedAndroidTest \
  --tests "com.eunio.healthapp.android.sync.AndroidToIOSSyncTest"
```

#### Step 2: Verify Android Test Results

Expected console output:
```
‚úÖ Android to iOS Sync Test: Daily log created successfully
üìù Test Data Summary:
   Date: October 10, 2025
   Period Flow: Light
   Symptoms: Headache, Cramps
   Mood: Happy
   BBT: 98.2¬∞F
   Notes: Android to iOS sync test - October 10, 2025

‚è≥ Waiting for Firebase sync to complete...
```

#### Step 3: Wait for Firebase Sync

**IMPORTANT:** Wait 10-15 seconds after Android tests complete to allow Firebase sync to finish.

You can verify sync in Firebase Console:
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Look for collection: `dailyLogs` or `users/{userId}/dailyLogs`
4. Verify document exists with date: `2025-10-10`

### Phase 2: iOS Verification

#### Step 4: Run iOS Verification Tests

```bash
# Open Xcode project
cd iosApp
open iosApp.xcodeproj

# Or run from command line:
xcodebuild test \
  -project iosApp.xcodeproj \
  -scheme iosApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  -only-testing:iosAppUITests/AndroidToIOSSyncVerificationTests
```

#### Step 5: Verify iOS Test Results

Expected console output:
```
üì± iOS Sync Verification Test: Checking for Android-created log
   Expected Date: October 10, 2025
   Expected Data: Period Flow=Light, Mood=Happy, BBT=98.2

## Manual Verification (Alternative)

If automated tests fail or are unavailable, follow these manual steps:

### Manual Android Steps

1. Open Android app
2. Navigate to Daily Logging screen
3. Verify date is October 10, 2025
4. Fill in test data:
   - Period Flow: Light
   - Symptoms: Headache, Cramps
   - Mood: Happy
   - BBT: 98.2
   - Notes: "Manual Android to iOS sync test"
5. Tap "Save"
6. Verify success message
7. Wait 15 seconds for sync

### Manual iOS Steps

1. Open iOS app
2. Navigate to Daily Logging screen
3. Tap date picker
4. Select October 10, 2025
5. Verify the following data appears:
   - Period Flow: Light
   - Symptoms: Headache, Cramps
   - Mood: Happy
   - BBT: 98.2¬∞F
   - Notes: "Manual Android to iOS sync test"
6. Verify date is displayed as October 10, 2025 (not shifted)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: iOS tests fail to find synced data

**Possible Causes:**
1. Firebase sync hasn't completed yet
2. Different user accounts on Android and iOS
3. Network connectivity issues
4. Firebase configuration mismatch

**Solutions:**
1. Wait longer (30-60 seconds) and re-run iOS tests
2. Verify same user is logged in on both platforms
3. Check internet connection on both devices
4. Verify Firebase project ID matches in both apps

### Issue: Date appears shifted by one day

**Possible Causes:**
1. Timezone conversion issue
2. Date stored as timestamp instead of LocalDate
3. Different timezone settings on devices

**Solutions:**
1. Check that date is stored as LocalDate (not Instant)
2. Verify timezone handling in Firebase serialization
3. Check device timezone settings

### Issue: Some data fields are missing

**Possible Causes:**
1. Incomplete save on Android
2. Serialization issue
3. Firebase security rules blocking fields

**Solutions:**
1. Re-run Android test and verify save completes
2. Check Firebase Console to see what data was written
3. Review Firestore security rules

### Issue: Authentication errors

**Possible Causes:**
1. User not logged in
2. Token expired
3. Firebase Auth not configured

**Solutions:**
1. Log in on both devices before running tests
2. Restart apps to refresh auth tokens
3. Verify Firebase Auth is enabled in console
