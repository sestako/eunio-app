# Quick Test: iOS Save Persistence Fix

## What Was Fixed

Data now persists when you navigate between dates on iOS.

## Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Save Data
1. Open iOS app
2. Go to October 10, 2025
3. Enter any data (e.g., Mood: Calm, Notes: "Test")
4. Click **Save**
5. ✅ See "Log saved successfully"

### Step 2: Navigate Away
1. Click **Next Day** (go to October 11)
2. ✅ See empty form (no data for Oct 11)

### Step 3: Navigate Back
1. Click **Previous Day** (back to October 10)
2. ✅ **Your data should still be there!**

## Expected Result

✅ **PASS:** Data persists on October 10  
❌ **FAIL:** Data disappeared (old bug)

## If Test Passes

The fix is working! Data now saves to local cache and persists correctly.

## If Test Fails

1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify you're logged in
3. Try rebuilding the app
4. Check Firebase connection

## What Changed

**Before:** iOS saved directly to Firebase, bypassing local cache  
**After:** iOS uses shared Kotlin ViewModel, which saves to cache + Firebase  

**Result:** Cache stays synchronized, data persists ✅
