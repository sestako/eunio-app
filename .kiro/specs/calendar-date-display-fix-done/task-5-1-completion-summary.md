## Test Data

### Primary Test Case (October 10, 2025)
```
Date: October 10, 2025
Period Flow: Light
Symptoms: Headache, Cramps
Mood: Happy
BBT: 98.2°F
Notes: "Android to iOS sync test - October 10, 2025"
```

### Multiple Date Test Cases
```

October 11, 2025: Note "Oct 11 test"
October 12, 2025: Note "Oct 12 test"
```

## How to Run Tests

### Quick Start (Automated)
```bash
# From project root
./test-android-to-ios-sync.sh
```

### Manual Execution

#### Step 1: Run Android Tests
```bash
./gradlew :androidApp:connectedAndroidTest \
  --tests "com.eunio.healthapp.android.sync.AndroidToIOSSyncTest"
```

#### Step 2: Wait for Firebase Sync
Wait 10-15 seconds for Firebase sync to complete.

#### Step 3: Run iOS Tests
```bash
cd iosApp
xcodebuild test \
  -project iosApp.xcodeproj \
  -scheme iosApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  -only-testing:iosAppUITests/AndroidToIOSSyncVerificationTests
```

### Manual Verification (Alternative)

If automated tests are not available:

1. **On Android:**
   - Open app and navigate to Daily Logging
   - Select October 10, 2025
   - Fill in test data (see above)
   - Save the log
   - Wait 15 seconds

2. **On iOS:**
   - Open app and navigate to Daily Logging
   - Select October 10, 2025
   - Verify all data appears correctly
   - Verify date is October 10, 2025 (not shifted)

## Success Criteria

All of the following must be true for task completion:

- ✅ Android tests run successfully and create logs
- ✅ Firebase sync completes without errors
- ✅ iOS tests run successfully and find synced logs
- ✅ All data fields match between Android and iOS
- ✅ Dates are correct on both platforms (no shifting)
- ✅ Multiple dates sync correctly
- ✅ No timezone conversion issues
- ✅ Requirements 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6 are satisfied

## Technical Implementation Details

### Android Test Architecture

The Android tests use Jetpack Compose testing framework:
- `createComposeRule()` for UI testing
- `performClick()` for user interactions
- `performTextInput()` for data entry
- `assertExists()` and `assertIsDisplayed()` for verification

### iOS Test Architecture

The iOS tests use XCTest framework:
- `XCUIApplication` for app control
- `waitForExistence()` for async verification
- `NSPredicate` for flexible element matching
- Helper functions for date navigation

### Firebase Sync Mechanism

The tests rely on the existing Firebase sync infrastructure:
- `DailyLogService` interface for data operations
- Firestore for cloud storage
- Automatic sync when logs are created/updated
- Real-time listeners for data updates

### Date Handling

Critical for preventing timezone issues:
- Dates stored as `LocalDate` (not `Instant`)
- ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- No timezone conversion during serialization
- Consistent date parsing on both platforms

## Known Limitations

1. **Timing Dependency**
   - Tests require waiting for Firebase sync
   - Network latency can affect test reliability
   - Recommended wait time: 10-15 seconds

2. **Authentication Requirement**
   - User must be logged in on both platforms
   - Same user account required for sync
   - Tests don't handle authentication setup

3. **UI Element Matching**
   - Tests rely on specific UI text and accessibility labels
   - Changes to UI strings may break tests
   - Localization not currently supported in tests

4. **Manual Verification Component**
   - Some verification steps are manual
   - Automated tests provide guidance but require human verification
   - Full automation would require more complex test infrastructure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** iOS tests can't find synced data
- **Solution:** Wait longer (30-60 seconds) and retry
- **Solution:** Verify same user is logged in on both platforms
- **Solution:** Check Firebase Console to confirm data was written

**Issue:** Date appears shifted by one day
- **Solution:** Verify date is stored as LocalDate, not Instant
- **Solution:** Check timezone handling in serialization
- **Solution:** Review device timezone settings

**Issue:** Some data fields are missing
- **Solution:** Re-run Android test and verify save completes
- **Solution:** Check Firebase Console for actual data
- **Solution:** Review Firestore security rules

## Next Steps

After completing Task 5.1, proceed to:

1. **Task 5.2:** Test iOS to Android sync
   - Create logs on iOS
   - Verify they appear on Android
   - Use similar test structure in reverse

2. **Task 5.3:** Test bidirectional updates
   - Update existing logs on Android
   - Verify updates sync to iOS
   - Update logs on iOS
   - Verify updates sync to Android

3. **Task 5.4:** Test multiple date sync integrity
   - Comprehensive multi-date testing
   - Edge case verification
   - Performance testing with many logs
