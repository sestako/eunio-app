# iOS Calendar Date Display Verification Report

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Summary

The iOS calendar date display implementation has been reviewed and fixed to match the Android implementation. A critical bug was identified and corrected where the quick date selection buttons were calculating dates relative to the current system date instead of the selected date.

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Incorrect Date Calculation Reference
**Location:** `iosApp/iosApp/Views/Logging/DailyLoggingView.swift` - `quickDateButton(daysAgo:)` function

**Problem:**
```swift
// BEFORE (INCORRECT)
let date = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -daysAgo, to: Date()) ?? Date()
```

The function was calculating dates relative to `Date()` (current system date) instead of `viewModel.selectedDate`. This meant:
- When the user selected October 10, 2025, the quick date buttons would still show dates relative to today
- The date navigation was inconsistent with the selected date
- Users would see incorrect dates in the quick selection row

**Solution:**
```swift
// AFTER (CORRECT)
let date = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: dayOffset, to: viewModel.selectedDate) ?? viewModel.selectedDate
```

Now the dates are calculated relative to the selected date, matching the Android implementation.

### Issue 1b: Incorrect Date Range Direction
**Location:** `iosApp/iosApp/Views/Logging/DailyLoggingView.swift` - Date range iteration

**Problem:**
```swift
// BEFORE (INCORRECT)
ForEach(0..<7, id: \.self) { index in quickDateButton(daysAgo: index) }
// This created dates going backward: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
```

The iOS implementation was showing dates going backward from the selected date (using negative offsets only), while Android shows dates centered around the selected date (-3 to +3).

**Solution:**
```swift
// AFTER (CORRECT)
ForEach(-3...3, id: \.self) { offset in quickDateButton(dayOffset: offset) }
// This creates dates centered around selected: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
```

Now the date range matches Android: 3 days before, the selected date, and 3 days after.

### Issue 2: Missing Accessibility Labels
**Location:** Date navigation section and quick date buttons

**Problem:**
- Navigation buttons lacked descriptive accessibility labels
- Quick date buttons had no accessibility hints
- Selected date state was not announced to VoiceOver users

**Solution:**
Added comprehensive accessibility support:
- Previous/Next day buttons: Clear labels ("Go to previous day", "Go to next day")
- Selected date button: Full date announcement with hint to open picker
- Quick date buttons: Month and day announcement with selection state
- ScrollView: Descriptive label and hint for browsing dates

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Date Calculation
**File:** `iosApp/iosApp/Views/Logging/DailyLoggingView.swift`

Changed the `quickDateButton(daysAgo:)` function to calculate dates relative to `viewModel.selectedDate` instead of `Date()`.

### 2. Enhanced Accessibility
Added accessibility labels and hints to:
- Previous day button
- Next day button
- Selected date display button
- Quick date selection buttons
- Quick date selection scroll view

### 3. Improved Consistency with Android
The iOS implementation now matches the Android implementation in:
- Date calculation logic (relative to selected date)
- Accessibility features (descriptive labels and hints)
- User experience (consistent date navigation)

## Comparison: iOS vs Android

### Date Calculation Logic

**Android:**
```kotlin
val currentDate = remember(selectedDate) {
    try {
        LocalDate.parse(selectedDate)
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Clock.System.todayIn(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault())
    }
}

val dateRange = remember(currentDate) {
    (-3..3).map { offset ->
        val date = currentDate.plus(offset, DateTimeUnit.DAY)
        DateDisplay(
            date = date,
            dayNumber = date.dayOfMonth,
            monthAbbreviation = date.month.name.take(3).lowercase()
                .replaceFirstChar { it.uppercase() },
            isSelected = offset == 0
        )
    }
}
```

**iOS (After Fix):**
```swift
// Date range: -3 to +3 days from selected date
ForEach(-3...3, id: \.self) { offset in quickDateButton(dayOffset: offset) }

private func quickDateButton(dayOffset: Int) -> some View {
    let date = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: dayOffset, to: viewModel.selectedDate) ?? viewModel.selectedDate
    let isSelected = Calendar.current.isDate(date, inSameDayAs: viewModel.selectedDate)
    // ... rendering logic
}
```

Both implementations now:
- Calculate dates relative to the selected date
- Handle edge cases (month/year boundaries)
- Provide proper fallback behavior
- Display day number and month abbreviation

### Accessibility Features

**Android:**
- Content descriptions for all interactive elements
- Live region announcements for date changes
- Minimum touch target sizes (48dp)
- Role-based semantics

**iOS (After Fix):**
- Accessibility labels for all buttons
- Accessibility hints for user guidance
- Selection state announcements
- VoiceOver-friendly navigation

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Date Display Verification**
   - [ ] Open Daily Logging screen on October 10, 2025
   - [ ] Verify quick selection shows dates around October 10 (Oct 7-13)
   - [ ] Confirm day numbers and month abbreviations are correct

2. **Date Navigation Testing**
   - [ ] Click previous day button
   - [ ] Verify quick selection updates to show dates around October 9
   - [ ] Click next day button twice
   - [ ] Verify quick selection updates to show dates around October 11

3. **Edge Case Testing**
   - [ ] Test with dates near month boundaries (e.g., October 1, October 31)
   - [ ] Test with dates near year boundaries (e.g., January 1, December 31)
   - [ ] Verify month abbreviations change correctly

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - [ ] Enable VoiceOver
   - [ ] Navigate through date controls
   - [ ] Verify all buttons have clear announcements
   - [ ] Verify selected date state is announced
   - [ ] Test quick date selection with VoiceOver gestures

5. **Consistency Testing**
   - [ ] Compare iOS date display with Android
   - [ ] Verify both show the same dates for the same selected date
   - [ ] Confirm navigation behavior is consistent

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 1.1 ✅
**WHEN the user opens the Daily Logging screen THEN the quick date selection row SHALL display dates relative to the currently selected date**

Status: FIXED - Dates are now calculated relative to `viewModel.selectedDate`

### Requirement 1.2 ✅
**WHEN the selected date is October 10, 2025 THEN the calendar SHALL show dates around October 10**

Status: FIXED - Quick date buttons now show dates relative to selected date

### Requirement 1.3 ✅
**WHEN the user navigates to a different date using the arrow buttons THEN the quick date selection row SHALL update to show dates relative to the new selected date**

Status: FIXED - Date calculation updates when `viewModel.selectedDate` changes

### Requirement 1.4 ✅
**WHEN the quick date selection displays dates THEN each date SHALL show the correct day number and month abbreviation**

Status: VERIFIED - iOS correctly extracts day number and formats month abbreviation

### Requirement 2.1 ✅
**WHEN the calendar renders the quick date selection THEN it SHALL calculate dates dynamically based on the selected date**

Status: FIXED - Dates are calculated dynamically using `Calendar.current.date(byAdding:)`

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
**WHEN calculating dates for the quick selection row THEN the system SHALL use the actual selected date from the UI state**

Status: FIXED - Now uses `viewModel.selectedDate` instead of `Date()`

### Requirement 2.3 ✅
**WHEN displaying dates THEN the system SHALL correctly format both the day number and month abbreviation**

Status: VERIFIED - Uses `Calendar.current.component(.day, from:)` and `.dateTime.month(.abbreviated)`

### Requirement 2.4 ✅
**WHEN the selected date changes THEN the quick date selection SHALL immediately reflect the new date range**

Status: VERIFIED - SwiftUI automatically updates when `viewModel.selectedDate` changes

## Conclusion

The iOS calendar date display implementation has been successfully fixed and now matches the Android implementation. The key changes were:

1. **Fixed date calculation** to use `viewModel.selectedDate` instead of `Date()`
2. **Enhanced accessibility** with proper labels and hints
3. **Improved consistency** with Android implementation

All requirements (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) are now satisfied. The implementation is ready for testing.

## Next Steps

1. Perform manual testing using the checklist above
2. Test with VoiceOver to verify accessibility
3. Compare side-by-side with Android to ensure consistency
4. Proceed to cross-platform Firebase sync testing (Task 5)
