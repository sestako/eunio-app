# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the broken test infrastructure that is preventing proper validation of code changes and fixes. The test compilation is failing with hundreds of errors related to missing dependencies, interface mismatches, and unresolved references. Fixing this infrastructure is critical for ensuring code quality and enabling proper validation of the critical infrastructure fixes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Compilation Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to compile successfully, so that I can run automated tests to validate code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running ./gradlew shared:testDebugUnitTest THEN all test files SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN test compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be no "Unresolved reference" errors
3. WHEN test compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be no "Class is not abstract" errors  
4. WHEN test compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be no "Type mismatch" errors
5. WHEN test compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be no warnings such as unchecked casts, deprecations, or type safety issues
6. IF test compilation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issues

### Requirement 2: Mock Services and Test Utilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly implemented mock services and test utilities, so that tests can run with consistent and predictable dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require mock services THEN all mock implementations SHALL properly implement their interfaces
2. WHEN mock services are used THEN they SHALL provide consistent behavior across test runs
3. WHEN test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be available and properly configured
4. WHEN abstract classes are mocked THEN all abstract members SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN dependency injection is used in tests THEN mock services SHALL support Koin overrides allowing real implementations to be replaced with mocks in test modules
6. IF mock services fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 3: Data Model and Interface Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test data models to match current interface definitions, so that tests accurately reflect the actual application behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests create data models THEN they SHALL use current constructor parameters and field names
2. WHEN tests interact with interfaces THEN they SHALL use current method signatures
3. WHEN data models change THEN test models SHALL be updated to match
4. WHEN interfaces evolve THEN test implementations SHALL be updated accordingly
5. IF model mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear compilation errors

### Requirement 4: Dependency Injection Test Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test infrastructure that supports dependency injection testing, so that I can validate DI configurations and component interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing DI configurations THEN tests SHALL be able to initialize Koin with test modules
2. WHEN testing component resolution THEN tests SHALL verify successful dependency injection
3. WHEN testing ViewModels THEN tests SHALL validate proper dependency resolution through DI
4. WHEN testing services THEN tests SHALL verify correct instantiation and behavior
5. IF DI tests fail THEN they SHALL provide detailed information about missing or misconfigured dependencies

### Requirement 5: Platform-Specific Test Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test infrastructure that works across Android and iOS platforms, so that I can validate cross-platform functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running Android unit tests THEN they SHALL execute successfully with proper Android context
2. WHEN running common tests THEN they SHALL work on both Android and iOS targets
3. WHEN platform-specific features are tested THEN appropriate platform mocks SHALL be available
4. WHEN cross-platform tests run THEN they SHALL validate consistent behavior across platforms
5. WHEN iOS tests are executed THEN they SHALL run successfully in CI/CD environments via Xcode command line, not only on local machines
6. IF platform tests fail THEN they SHALL clearly indicate which platform and why

### Requirement 6: Test Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast and reliable test execution, so that testing doesn't become a bottleneck in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 5 minutes for full suite)
2. WHEN tests run multiple times THEN they SHALL produce consistent results
3. WHEN tests are run in parallel THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other
4. WHEN test resources are used THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up after test completion
5. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL be deterministic, meaning test results cannot depend on execution order, current system time, or environment randomness
6. IF tests become slow or unreliable THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to identify issues
