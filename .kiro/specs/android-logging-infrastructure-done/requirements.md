# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Android application currently has inconsistent logging practices that make debugging and troubleshooting difficult. Many services use `println()` statements instead of Android's proper `Log` class, which means log messages don't appear in the Android logcat console with proper filtering, tagging, and log levels. This makes it challenging to monitor app behavior, debug issues, and track down problems in production.

This feature will standardize logging across the Android application by implementing a consistent logging infrastructure that uses Android's native logging capabilities properly, provides appropriate log levels, includes meaningful tags, and ensures all log messages are visible in the Android Studio logcat console.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Standardized Logging Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent logging interface across all Android code, so that I can easily add, find, and filter log messages during development and debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Android-specific code needs to log a message THEN it SHALL use Android's `Log` class (android.util.Log) instead of `println()` or `print()`
2. WHEN logging a message THEN the system SHALL include an appropriate log level (VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
3. WHEN logging a message THEN the system SHALL include a meaningful tag that identifies the source component or class
4. IF a log message includes an exception THEN the system SHALL pass the exception to the Log method for proper stack trace logging
5. WHEN the app is running THEN all log messages SHALL be visible in Android Studio's logcat console with proper filtering capabilities

### Requirement 2: Service Layer Logging Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Android service implementations to use proper logging, so that I can monitor service operations and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AndroidDailyLogService performs operations THEN it SHALL log using `Log.d()` or `Log.e()` instead of `println()`
2. WHEN AndroidUserProfileService performs operations THEN it SHALL log using `Log.d()` or `Log.e()` instead of `println()`
3. WHEN AndroidAuthService performs operations THEN it SHALL log using `Log.d()` or `Log.e()` instead of `println()`
4. WHEN AndroidSettingsManager performs operations THEN it SHALL log using `Log.d()` or `Log.w()` instead of `println()`
5. WHEN AndroidNavigationManager performs operations THEN it SHALL log using `Log.d()` instead of `println()`
6. WHEN any service logs a retry attempt THEN it SHALL use `Log.w()` to indicate a warning-level event
7. WHEN any service logs a failure after retries THEN it SHALL use `Log.e()` with the exception for error-level logging

### Requirement 3: Consistent Tag Naming Convention

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent tag naming across all log messages, so that I can easily filter and search for specific component logs in logcat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a class logs a message THEN it SHALL use a tag that matches or clearly identifies the class name
2. WHEN defining a log tag THEN it SHALL follow the pattern "ClassName" or "ComponentName" (e.g., "DailyLogService", "AuthService")
3. WHEN a tag is defined THEN it SHALL be declared as a constant at the class level (e.g., `private const val TAG = "AndroidDailyLogService"`)
4. WHEN multiple related classes exist THEN they MAY share a common tag prefix for easier filtering (e.g., "Service:DailyLog", "Service:Auth")
5. WHEN the app runs THEN developers SHALL be able to filter logcat by tag to see all messages from a specific component

### Requirement 4: Appropriate Log Level Usage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want log messages to use appropriate severity levels, so that I can quickly identify critical issues versus informational messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging routine operation information THEN the system SHALL use `Log.d()` (DEBUG level)
2. WHEN logging important state changes or milestones THEN the system SHALL use `Log.i()` (INFO level)
3. WHEN logging retry attempts or recoverable issues THEN the system SHALL use `Log.w()` (WARN level)
4. WHEN logging errors or exceptions THEN the system SHALL use `Log.e()` (ERROR level) with the exception parameter
5. WHEN logging very detailed trace information THEN the system SHALL use `Log.v()` (VERBOSE level)
6. WHEN an operation fails after all retries THEN it SHALL log at ERROR level with the full exception

### Requirement 5: Structured Log Messages

**User Story:** As a developer, I want log messages to be clear and structured, so that I can quickly understand what's happening in the app without ambiguity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging an operation start THEN the message SHALL clearly indicate what operation is beginning
2. WHEN logging an operation result THEN the message SHALL indicate success or failure with relevant details
3. WHEN logging retry attempts THEN the message SHALL include the attempt number, delay, and reason
4. WHEN logging errors THEN the message SHALL include context about what operation failed and why
5. WHEN logging data operations THEN the message SHALL include relevant identifiers (e.g., userId, logId, date) without exposing sensitive data
6. WHEN logging network operations THEN the message SHALL indicate the operation type and endpoint (if applicable)

### Requirement 6: Debug Build Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want verbose logging in debug builds but minimal logging in release builds, so that the app performs well in production while still providing debugging capabilities during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built in debug mode THEN all log levels (VERBOSE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) SHALL be active
2. WHEN the app is built in release mode THEN only WARN and ERROR logs SHALL be included (DEBUG, VERBOSE, INFO removed by ProGuard/R8)
3. WHEN using verbose logging THEN it SHALL be wrapped in a build config check if it has performance implications
4. WHEN the app is in production THEN logging SHALL not expose sensitive user data or security information
5. WHEN logging in release builds THEN the system SHALL still capture critical errors for crash reporting

### Requirement 7: Verification and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all logging is working correctly, so that I can trust the logging infrastructure during development and debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN a startup log message SHALL appear in logcat confirming logging is active
2. WHEN each major service initializes THEN it SHALL log an initialization message at INFO level
3. WHEN running the app in Android Studio THEN all log messages SHALL be visible in the logcat panel
4. WHEN filtering logcat by tag THEN only messages from that specific component SHALL appear
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the full stack trace SHALL be visible in logcat
6. WHEN testing the logging infrastructure THEN developers SHALL be able to trigger test log messages at each level to verify visibility
