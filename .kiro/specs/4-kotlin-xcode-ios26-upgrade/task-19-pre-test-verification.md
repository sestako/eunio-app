## Test Plan

### Phase 1: iOS Testing

1. **Sign-Up Test**:
   ```
   Action: Create new account on iOS
   Expected: User appears in Firebase Console
   Verify: Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
   ```

2. **Sign-In Test**:
   ```
   Action: Sign in with created account
   Expected: Successful sign-in, redirect to main app
   Verify: Console logs show Firebase sign-in
   ```

3. **Sign-Out Test**:
   ```
   Action: Sign out from settings
   Expected: Return to auth screen
   Verify: Firebase session ends
   ```

4. **Password Reset Test**:
   ```
   Action: Request password reset
   Expected: Receive Firebase email
   Verify: Check email inbox
   ```

### Phase 2: Android Testing

1. **Sign-In Test**:
   ```
   Action: Sign in with iOS-created account
   Expected: Successful sign-in
   Verify: Same user, cross-platform works
   ```

2. **Sign-Up Test**:
   ```
   Action: Create new account on Android
   Expected: User appears in Firebase Console
   Verify: Firebase Console shows new user
   ```

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Testing

1. **iOS → Android**:
   ```
   Action: Create user on iOS, sign in on Android
   Expected: Works seamlessly
   ```

2. **Android → iOS**:
   ```
   Action: Create user on Android, sign in on iOS
   Expected: Works seamlessly
   ```

### Phase 4: Error Handling

1. **Wrong Password**:
   ```
   Action: Enter incorrect password
   Expected: Firebase error message displayed
   ```

2. **Duplicate Email**:
   ```
   Action: Sign up with existing email
   Expected: "Email already in use" error
   ```

3. **Network Error**:
   ```
   Action: Disable network, try to sign in
   Expected: Network error message
   ```

---

## Expected Console Logs

### iOS Sign-Up Success:
```
✅ AuthViewModel: Firebase sign up successful, posted notification
🔐 AuthenticationManager: Received UserDidSignIn notification
🔐 AuthenticationManager: checkAuthState - authenticated: true
```

### iOS Sign-In Success:
```
✅ AuthViewModel: Firebase sign in successful, posted notification
🔐 AuthenticationManager: Received UserDidSignIn notification
🔐 AuthenticationManager: checkAuthState - authenticated: true
```

### Android Sign-In Success:
```
AuthService: Successfully signed in user: user@example.com
FirebaseAuth: User authenticated: [user_id]
```

---

## Firebase Console Verification

After testing, verify in Firebase Console:

1. **Authentication → Users**:
   - [ ] Users from iOS visible
   - [ ] Users from Android visible
   - [ ] Firebase UIDs present
   - [ ] Email addresses correct
   - [ ] Last sign-in timestamps updated

2. **Authentication → Sign-in method**:
   - [ ] Email/Password enabled
   - [ ] No errors or warnings

3. **Authentication → Settings**:
   - [ ] Authorized domains configured
   - [ ] Email templates set up

---

## Known Differences

### iOS vs Android Architecture

**iOS**:
```
AuthViewModel → SwiftAuthService → Firebase SDK
```

**Android**:
```
AuthViewModel → Use Cases → AndroidAuthService → Firebase SDK
```

**Why Different?**:
- iOS uses direct Swift Firebase SDK (simpler, native)
- Android uses Kotlin Multiplatform architecture (consistent with KMP)
- Both achieve the same result: Real Firebase authentication

**Impact**: None - both work correctly with Firebase
