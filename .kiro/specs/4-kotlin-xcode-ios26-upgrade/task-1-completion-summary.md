   - Kotlin 2.2.20 release notes summary
   - iOS 26 SDK release notes summary
   - Xcode 26 release notes summary
   - Dependency update notes (Ktor 3.0, Koin 4.0)
   - Action items list

3. **rollback-plan.md** (spec directory)
   - Complete rollback procedures
   - Multiple rollback strategies
   - Verification steps

## Git Status

- **Current Branch**: `upgrade/kotlin-2.2-ios26`
- **Repository Status**: Initialized (was not previously a git repo)
- **Files**: All project files are untracked (ready for initial commit)

## Key Findings

### Current Environment
- **Kotlin**: 1.9.21
- **Gradle**: 8.5 (downloaded during verification)
- **Xcode**: Not installed (only Command Line Tools present)
- **macOS**: 26.0.1 (Tahoe) - Already on required version for CI/CD
- **JVM**: 17.0.16

### Upgrade Requirements Confirmed
- Kotlin 2.2.20 upgrade is feasible
- All dependencies have compatible versions available
- Xcode 26 installation will be required for iOS development
- Gradle upgrade to 8.10+ will be needed
- Two major dependency upgrades identified: Ktor (2.x → 3.x) and Koin (3.x → 4.x)

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Most dependencies have minor version updates
- **Medium Risk**: Ktor and Koin major version changes require migration
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive rollback plan in place
- **Safety**: Upgrade branch created for safe experimentation

## Next Steps

The preparation phase is complete. Ready to proceed with:
- **Task 2**: Update Kotlin version and compiler plugins
- **Task 3**: Update Compose Multiplatform and UI dependencies
- **Task 4**: Update Ktor client to version 3.x
- And subsequent tasks as defined in tasks.md

## Requirements Satisfied

This task satisfies the following requirements:
- ✅ **Requirement 10.1**: Rollback plan documents how to revert Kotlin version
- ✅ **Requirement 10.2**: Rollback plan documents how to revert Xcode version
- ✅ **Requirement 10.3**: Rollback plan documents how to revert dependency versions
- ✅ **Requirement 10.4**: Git branch strategy for safe upgrade documented
- ✅ **Requirement 9.1**: Version changes documented
- ✅ **Requirement 9.2**: Reasons for changes documented

## Notes

- Git repository was initialized during this task (didn't exist previously)
- macOS 26 (Tahoe) is already installed, which is the required version for CI/CD
- Xcode installation will be required in later tasks
- All documentation is comprehensive and ready for team review
- Rollback procedures are well-defined with multiple options
