# Task 26: CI/CD Pipeline Update - Completion Summary

## Overview

Successfully updated CI/CD pipelines to support Kotlin 2.2.20, Xcode 26, and iOS 26 SDK with comprehensive toolchain verification, caching, and testing.

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Date:** October 30, 2024

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Main Build and Test Workflow (`build-and-test.yml`)

Created a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with the following jobs:

#### Job 1: Verify Toolchain
- Validates Kotlin 2.2.20
- Validates Gradle 8.10+
- Validates Xcode 26.x (macOS only)
- Runs `scripts/verify-toolchain.sh`
- Fails build if versions are incorrect

#### Job 2: Android Build and Test
- Builds shared module
- Builds Android APK
- Runs Android unit tests
- Uploads build artifacts and test results
- Implements Gradle caching (dependencies, wrapper, Kotlin cache)

#### Job 3: iOS Build and Test
- Builds iOS frameworks (arm64 and simulator arm64)
- Installs CocoaPods dependencies
- Builds iOS app in Xcode
- Runs iOS tests
- Implements both Gradle and CocoaPods caching
- Uses latest available macOS runner

#### Job 4: Shared Module Tests
- Runs shared module unit tests
- Uploads test results
- Implements Gradle caching

#### Job 5: Test Summary
- Collects all test results
- Generates comprehensive summary report
- Fails if any job failed
- Uploads summary with 30-day retention

### 2. Enhanced Comprehensive Testing Workflow

Updated existing `comprehensive-testing.yml` with:
- Added toolchain verification as first job
- All jobs now depend on toolchain verification
- Enhanced Gradle caching to include Kotlin compilation cache
- Updated cache keys to include `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- Added environment variables for Kotlin version
- Updated test summary to include toolchain verification results

### 3. Toolchain Verification Test Workflow

Created `toolchain-verification-test.yml` for testing the verification script:
- **Test Scenario 1:** Correct versions (should pass)
- **Test Scenario 2:** Wrong Kotlin version (should fail)
- **Test Scenario 3:** Wrong Gradle version (should fail)
- Manual workflow dispatch with scenario selection
- Validates that verification script correctly detects mismatches

### 4. CI/CD Documentation

Created comprehensive `README.md` in `.github/workflows/` covering:
- Overview of all workflows
- Detailed job descriptions
- Caching strategy and configuration
- Toolchain verification process
- Runner requirements
- Artifact retention policies
- Troubleshooting guide
- Local testing with `act`
- Maintenance procedures
- Best practices

## Key Features

### ✅ Toolchain Verification
- Pre-check step in all workflows
- Validates Kotlin, Gradle, and Xcode versions
- Fails fast if versions are incorrect
- Clear error messages with expected vs actual versions

### ✅ Comprehensive Caching

**Gradle Cache:**
```yaml
path: |
  ~/.gradle/caches
  ~/.gradle/wrapper
  ~/.gradle/kotlin
key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties', 'gradle/libs.versions.toml') }}
```

**CocoaPods Cache (iOS):**
```yaml
path: |
  iosApp/Pods
  ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods
key: ${{ runner.os }}-pods-${{ hashFiles('**/Podfile.lock') }}
```

### ✅ Multi-Platform Support
- Android builds on Ubuntu runners
- iOS builds on macOS runners
- Shared module tests on Ubuntu
- Cross-platform consistency validation

### ✅ Artifact Management
- Build artifacts (APKs) - 7 days
- Test results - 7 days
- Test summaries - 30 days
- Comprehensive reports - 30 days

### ✅ Failure Handling
- Each job has appropriate timeout
- Test results uploaded even on failure
- Summary job runs even if tests fail
- Clear failure reporting in summary

## Workflow Files Created/Updated

### Created:
1. `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
2. `.github/workflows/toolchain-verification-test.yml` - Verification testing
3. `.github/workflows/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Updated:
1. `.github/workflows/comprehensive-testing.yml` - Enhanced with toolchain verification and better caching

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
All workflows include:
- Unit tests for shared module
- Unit tests for Android
- Unit tests for iOS (when available)
- Cross-platform consistency validation
- Test result collection and reporting

### Manual Testing Available
- Workflow dispatch for all workflows

## Caching Performance

Expected cache hit rates:
- **Gradle cache:** 80-90% hit rate (invalidates on dependency changes)
- **CocoaPods cache:** 90-95% hit rate (invalidates on Podfile.lock changes)

Expected build time improvements:
- **With cache hit:** 50-70% faster builds
- **Cold cache:** Normal build time
- **Partial cache:** 20-40% faster builds

## Runner Configuration

### Ubuntu Runners (Android/Shared)
- OS: ubuntu-latest
- Java: 17 (Temurin)

|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Android APK | 7 days | Build verification |
| Test Results | 7 days | Debugging failures |
| Test Summary | 30 days | Historical tracking |
| Comprehensive Report | 30 days | Audit trail |

## Environment Variables

All workflows define:
```yaml
env:

```

## Triggers

### build-and-test.yml
- Push to: `main`, `develop`, `upgrade/**`
- Pull requests to: `main`, `develop`
- Manual dispatch

## Next Steps

### When macOS 26 (Tahoe) Runners Become Available:
1. Update runner OS from `macos-14` to `macos-26`
2. Verify Xcode 26 is available on new runners
3. Test iOS builds on new runners
4. Update documentation

### Ongoing Maintenance:
1. Monitor cache hit rates
2. Adjust cache keys if needed
3. Update timeouts based on actual build times
4. Review and update artifact retention policies
5. Keep documentation up to date

## Verification

To verify the CI/CD setup:

1. **Push a commit to trigger workflows:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "Update CI/CD pipelines for Kotlin 2.2.20 and Xcode 26"
   git push
   ```

2. **Check workflow runs in GitHub Actions UI:**
   - Go to repository → Actions tab
   - Verify all jobs complete successfully
   - Check that toolchain verification runs first
   - Verify caching is working (check job logs)

3. **Test toolchain verification failure:**
   - Go to Actions → Toolchain Verification Test
   - Run workflow with "simulate-wrong-kotlin" scenario
   - Verify it fails as expected

4. **Review artifacts:**
   - Check that APK is uploaded
   - Check that test results are available
   - Check that summary report is generated

## Success Criteria

All success criteria met:

- ✅ Toolchain verification runs as first job
- ✅ All jobs depend on toolchain verification
- ✅ Gradle caching configured with comprehensive paths
