# Task 8.1 Completion Summary: Add Security Rules for New Collection Path

## Overview
Successfully added Firebase security rules for the new standardized collection path `users/{userId}/dailyLogs/{logId}` while maintaining the legacy path rules for backward compatibility during migration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated firestore.rules
**File**: `firestore.rules`

Added security rules for the new collection path:
```javascript
// Daily logs (new standardized path) - users can only read/write their own logs
match /users/{userId}/dailyLogs/{logId} {
  allow read: if isOwner(userId);
  allow write: if isOwner(userId);
}
```

### Security Rule Implementation Details

#### Authentication Check
- Uses the existing `isOwner(userId)` helper function
- Verifies that `request.auth != null` (user is authenticated)
- Verifies that `request.auth.uid == userId` (user owns the resource)

#### Access Control
- **Read Access**: Only the authenticated user whose `uid` matches the `userId` in the path can read their daily logs
- **Write Access**: Only the authenticated user whose `uid` matches the `userId` in the path can write their daily logs
- **Deny Other Users**: Any attempt by another user to access data will be denied automatically

#### Path Structure
- New path: `users/{userId}/dailyLogs/{logId}`
- Legacy path: `daily_logs/{userId}/logs/{logId}` (maintained for migration period)

## Requirements Verification

### ✅ Requirement 8.1: Allow read/write to `users/{userId}/dailyLogs/{logId}` where `request.auth.uid == userId`
- Implemented using `isOwner(userId)` helper function
- Rule checks: `isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId`

### ✅ Requirement 8.2: Deny access to other users' data
- Implicit denial through the `isOwner(userId)` check
- If `request.auth.uid != userId`, the rule evaluates to `false` and access is denied
- Default deny-all rule at the end ensures no unauthorized access

### ✅ Requirement 8.3: Ensure users can access their own data
- Users with matching `uid` and `userId` have full read/write access
- Both read and write operations are allowed for authenticated owners

## Security Rules Structure

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Helper function to check if user is authenticated
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Helper function to check if user owns the resource
    function isOwner(userId) {
      return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Daily logs (new standardized path)
    match /users/{userId}/dailyLogs/{logId} {
      allow read: if isOwner(userId);
      allow write: if isOwner(userId);
    }
    
    // Daily logs (legacy path) - maintained for migration
    match /daily_logs/{userId}/logs/{logId} {
      allow read: if isOwner(userId);
      allow write: if isOwner(userId);
    }
    
    // Default deny-all rule
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing the Security Rules

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Deploy the rules to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Test authenticated user access (should succeed)**:
   - Authenticate as user with uid "user123"
   - Try to read: `users/user123/dailyLogs/2025-10-13`
   - Try to write: `users/user123/dailyLogs/2025-10-13`
   - Both operations should succeed

3. **Test unauthorized access (should fail)**:
   - Authenticate as user with uid "user123"
   - Try to read: `users/user456/dailyLogs/2025-10-13`
   - Try to write: `users/user456/dailyLogs/2025-10-13`
   - Both operations should fail with permission denied

4. **Test unauthenticated access (should fail)**:
   - Without authentication
   - Try to read: `users/user123/dailyLogs/2025-10-13`
   - Try to write: `users/user123/dailyLogs/2025-10-13`
   - Both operations should fail with permission denied

### Using Firebase Emulator for Testing

```bash
# Start the Firebase emulator
firebase emulators:start

# The emulator UI will be available at http://localhost:4000
# You can test security rules in the Firestore emulator
```

### Automated Testing with Firebase Rules Unit Tests

You can create unit tests for the security rules using the Firebase Rules Unit Testing library. Example test structure:

```javascript
const firebase = require('@firebase/rules-unit-testing');

describe('Daily Logs Security Rules', () => {
  it('should allow user to read their own daily logs', async () => {
    const db = firebase.initializeTestApp({
      projectId: 'test-project',
      auth: { uid: 'user123' }
    }).firestore();
    
    const doc = db.collection('users').doc('user123')
      .collection('dailyLogs').doc('2025-10-13');
    
    await firebase.assertSucceeds(doc.get());
  });
  
  it('should deny user from reading other users daily logs', async () => {
    const db = firebase.initializeTestApp({
      projectId: 'test-project',
      auth: { uid: 'user123' }
    }).firestore();
    
    const doc = db.collection('users').doc('user456')
      .collection('dailyLogs').doc('2025-10-13');
    
    await firebase.assertFails(doc.get());
  });
});
```

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the updated security rules to Firebase:

```bash
# Deploy only the Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Or deploy all Firebase resources
firebase deploy
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Security rules added for new path `users/{userId}/dailyLogs/{logId}`
- [x] Rules use `isOwner(userId)` helper function for authentication check
- [x] Rules allow read/write only when `request.auth.uid == userId`
- [x] Rules deny access to other users' data
- [x] Legacy path rules maintained for migration period
- [x] Default deny-all rule remains in place
- [x] Rules syntax is valid (follows rules_version = '2' format)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the rules**: Run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. **Test in production**: Verify that authenticated users can access their own data
3. **Monitor logs**: Check Firebase console for any permission denied errors
4. **Proceed to task 8.2**: Add legacy path rules for migration period (already included)
5. **Proceed to task 8.3**: Create Firestore indexes for efficient queries

## Notes

- The legacy path `daily_logs/{userId}/logs/{logId}` is maintained with the same security rules to support the migration period
- Both paths use the same `isOwner(userId)` helper function for consistency
- The default deny-all rule at the end ensures that any unmatched paths are denied by default
- Security rules are evaluated in order, and the first matching rule is applied
