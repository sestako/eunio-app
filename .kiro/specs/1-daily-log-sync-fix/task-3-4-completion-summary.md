# Task 3.4 Completion Summary: Sync Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff

## Task Description
Implement sync retry mechanism with exponential backoff for pending daily log changes.

## Requirements Addressed
- **Requirement 4.3**: Retry failed syncs with exponential backoff strategy
- **Requirement 4.4**: Mark as synced on success

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced `syncPendingChanges()` Function

**Location**: `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/data/repository/LogRepositoryImpl.kt`

The function now:
- Queries all logs marked as pending sync from the local database
- Attempts to sync each log with retry logic
- Returns detailed `SyncResult` with statistics
- Logs comprehensive structured information about the sync process

**Key Features**:
- Returns `Result<SyncResult>` instead of `Result<Unit>` for better observability
- Tracks success/failure counts and error messages
- Logs sync start, individual successes/failures, and completion with timing

### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

**Function**: `syncLogWithRetry()`

Implements exponential backoff retry strategy:
- **Maximum retries**: 5 attempts
- **Delay pattern**: 
  - Attempt 1: immediate (0ms)
  - Attempt 2: 1 second (1000ms)
  - Attempt 3: 2 seconds (2000ms)
  - Attempt 4: 4 seconds (4000ms)
  - Attempt 5: 8 seconds (8000ms)
- **Formula**: `baseDelay * 2^(attempt-1)` where baseDelay = 1000ms

**Behavior**:
- Attempts sync immediately on first try
- Applies exponential backoff delay before each retry
- Logs each retry attempt with delay information
- Returns success if any attempt succeeds
- Returns error after all retries exhausted

### 3. Backoff Delay Calculation

**Function**: `calculateBackoffDelay()`

Simple, testable function that calculates delay using bit shift:
```kotlin
private fun calculateBackoffDelay(attempt: Int): Long {
    val baseDelayMs = 1000L
    return baseDelayMs * (1 shl (attempt - 1)) // 2^(attempt-1)
}
```

### 4. SyncResult Data Class

**Location**: `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/data/repository/LogRepositoryImpl.kt`

New data class for sync operation results:
```kotlin
data class SyncResult(
    val totalLogs: Int,
    val successCount: Int,
    val failureCount: Int,
    val errors: List<String>
)
```

Provides detailed statistics about sync operations for monitoring and debugging.

### 5. Enhanced Structured Logging

**Location**: `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/domain/util/StructuredLogger.kt`

Added new log operations:
- `SYNC_START`: When sync operation begins
- `SYNC_SUCCESS`: When a log syncs successfully
- `SYNC_FAILURE`: When a log fails to sync
- `SYNC_COMPLETE`: When sync operation completes (with statistics)
- `RETRY_ATTEMPT`: When retrying a failed sync
- `RETRY_SUCCESS`: When a retry succeeds
- `RETRY_EXHAUSTED`: When max retries are exhausted

### 6. Test Documentation

**Location**: `shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/data/repository/LogRepositorySyncRetryTest.kt`

Created comprehensive test documentation covering:
- Exponential backoff calculation verification
- SyncResult data structure validation
- Max retry attempts verification (5 attempts)
- Structured logging operations documentation
- Total delay calculation (15 seconds for all retries)

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
1. `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/data/repository/LogRepositoryImpl.kt`
   - Enhanced `syncPendingChanges()` with detailed statistics and logging
   - Added `syncLogWithRetry()` for individual log retry logic
   - Added `calculateBackoffDelay()` for exponential backoff calculation
   - Added `SyncResult` data class

2. `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/domain/util/StructuredLogger.kt`
   - Added 7 new log operations for sync retry tracking

### Files Created
1. `shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/data/repository/LogRepositorySyncRetryTest.kt`
   - Documentation and behavioral tests for sync retry mechanism

## Behavior

### Success Scenario
1. Query pending logs from database
2. For each log:
   - Attempt sync to Firebase
   - If successful: mark as synced, increment success count
   - If failed: retry with exponential backoff
3. Return SyncResult with statistics

### Failure Scenario
1. Query pending logs from database
2. For each log:
   - Attempt sync (fails)
   - Retry with 1s delay (fails)
   - Retry with 2s delay (fails)
   - Retry with 4s delay (fails)
   - Retry with 8s delay (fails)
   - Give up after 5 attempts
   - Log remains in PENDING state
   - Increment failure count, add error to list
3. Return SyncResult with statistics

### Partial Success Scenario
- Some logs sync successfully (marked as SYNCED)
- Some logs fail after retries (remain PENDING)
- SyncResult reflects both successes and failures
- Failed logs will be retried in next sync cycle

## Logging Examples

```
[DailyLogSync] SYNC_START pendingCount=3, timestamp=1696392000
[DailyLogSync] SYNC_SUCCESS logId=2025-10-04, userId=user123, dateEpochDays=20259
[DailyLogSync] RETRY_ATTEMPT logId=2025-10-05, attempt=2, maxRetries=5, delayMs=1000
[DailyLogSync] RETRY_SUCCESS logId=2025-10-05, attempt=2, path=users/user123/dailyLogs/2025-10-05
[DailyLogSync] RETRY_EXHAUSTED logId=2025-10-06, maxRetries=5, error=Network error
[DailyLogSync] SYNC_FAILURE logId=2025-10-06, userId=user123, error=Network error
[DailyLogSync] SYNC_COMPLETE totalLogs=3, successCount=2, failureCount=1, durationMs=15234
```

## Integration Points

### Called By
- Background sync service (to be implemented)
- Manual sync trigger from UI
- App startup sync
- Network connectivity restored event

### Dependencies
- `DailyLogDao.getPendingSync()`: Query pending logs
- `DailyLogDao.markAsSynced()`: Mark successful syncs
- `FirestoreService.saveDailyLog()`: Sync to Firebase
- `StructuredLogger`: Log operations
- `kotlinx.coroutines.delay()`: Implement backoff delays

## Performance Considerations

### Timing
- Single log with immediate success: ~100-500ms (network latency)
- Single log with 2 retries: ~3+ seconds (1s + 2s delays + network)
- Single log with max retries: ~15+ seconds (1s + 2s + 4s + 8s + network)
- Multiple logs: processed sequentially, times add up

### Recommendations
- Run sync in background to avoid blocking UI
- Consider batch operations for large numbers of pending logs
- Implement max concurrent syncs if needed
- Add timeout per sync attempt to prevent indefinite hangs

## Future Enhancements

When Task 6 is completed (database sync metadata fields):
- Track `syncRetryCount` in database
- Store `lastSyncAttempt` timestamp
- Implement progressive backoff (increase delay for repeated failures)
- Add max retry count per log (give up after N sync cycles)
- Implement priority queue (sync recent logs first)

## Verification

### Manual Testing
1. Save a log while offline
2. Verify log is marked as PENDING in database
3. Go online and call `syncPendingChanges()`
4. Verify log syncs to Firebase
5. Verify log is marked as SYNCED in database
6. Check logs for structured logging output

### Integration Testing
1. Create multiple pending logs
2. Simulate network failures
3. Verify retry attempts with delays
4. Verify partial success handling
5. Verify statistics in SyncResult

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE**

All requirements for Task 3.4 have been implemented:
- ✅ Created `syncPendingChanges()` function
- ✅ Query all logs marked as pending sync
- ✅ Retry failed syncs with exponential backoff
- ✅ Mark as synced on success
- ✅ Comprehensive structured logging
- ✅ Detailed statistics and error tracking
- ✅ Test documentation

## Next Steps
- Task 4: Update iOS SwiftDailyLogService to use correct Firebase paths
- Task 5: Update Android AndroidDailyLogService to use correct Firebase paths
- Task 6: Add local database sync metadata fields (will enhance retry mechanism)
