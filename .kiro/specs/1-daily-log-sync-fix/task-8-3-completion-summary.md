# Task 8.3 Completion Summary: Create Firestore Indexes

## Task Description
Create Firestore indexes for efficient querying of daily logs by `dateEpochDays` field and composite queries with `updatedAt`.

## Requirements Addressed
- **8.6**: Create index on `dateEpochDays` field for efficient date-based queries
- **8.7**: Create composite index on `dateEpochDays` + `updatedAt` for conflict resolution queries

## Implementation Details

### Indexes Created

Updated `firestore.indexes.json` with the following composite indexes:

1. **Composite Index (Ascending)**
   - Collection Group: `dailyLogs`
   - Fields:
     - `dateEpochDays` (ASCENDING)
     - `updatedAt` (ASCENDING)
   - Purpose: Supports queries that filter/sort by date and need to check update timestamps

2. **Composite Index (Descending)**
   - Collection Group: `dailyLogs`
   - Fields:
     - `dateEpochDays` (DESCENDING)
     - `updatedAt` (DESCENDING)
   - Purpose: Supports reverse-order queries for most recent logs first

### Why Single-Field Indexes Were Not Added

Firestore automatically creates single-field indexes for all fields, so explicit single-field indexes on `dateEpochDays` alone are not necessary. The composite indexes above will handle:
- Range queries on `dateEpochDays`
- Sorting by `dateEpochDays`
- Combined queries filtering by date and sorting by update time

### Deployment

The indexes were successfully deployed to Firebase using:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

Deployment output confirmed:
```
✔  firestore: deployed indexes in firestore.indexes.json successfully for (default) database
```

## Query Performance Benefits

These indexes will optimize the following query patterns:

1. **Date Range Queries**
   ```kotlin
   collection("users/{userId}/dailyLogs")
     .whereGreaterThanOrEqualTo("dateEpochDays", startEpochDays)
     .whereLessThanOrEqualTo("dateEpochDays", endEpochDays)
     .orderBy("dateEpochDays", DESCENDING)
   ```

2. **Conflict Resolution Queries**
   ```kotlin
   collection("users/{userId}/dailyLogs")
     .whereEqualTo("dateEpochDays", epochDays)
     .orderBy("updatedAt", DESCENDING)
     .limit(1)
   ```

3. **Recent Logs with Date Filter**
   ```kotlin
   collection("users/{userId}/dailyLogs")
     .whereGreaterThan("dateEpochDays", cutoffEpochDays)
     .orderBy("dateEpochDays", DESCENDING)
     .orderBy("updatedAt", DESCENDING)
   ```

## Files Modified

- `firestore.indexes.json` - Added composite indexes for `dateEpochDays` + `updatedAt`

## Verification

✅ JSON syntax validated
✅ Indexes deployed successfully to Firebase
✅ Composite indexes created for both ascending and descending order
✅ Firestore console shows indexes are building/active

## Notes

- Single-field indexes on `dateEpochDays` are automatically created by Firestore
- Composite indexes are required for queries that filter/sort by multiple fields
- Both ascending and descending variants were created to support different query patterns
- The indexes will improve query performance for date range queries and conflict resolution logic

## Next Steps

The indexes are now deployed and will be used automatically by Firestore queries. Monitor the Firebase console to ensure indexes complete building (may take a few minutes for large datasets).
