# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The health app has 27 failing integration and end-to-end tests that are preventing proper validation of application functionality. These tests are compiling and running but failing with AssertionErrors, indicating that the expected behavior doesn't match the actual implementation. The failing tests cover critical user journeys including onboarding, authentication, cross-platform sync, error handling, and settings management. Fixing these tests is essential for ensuring the application works correctly across all platforms and scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: End-to-End User Journey Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all end-to-end user journey tests to pass, so that I can validate complete user workflows work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running onboarding journey tests THEN all onboarding flows SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN testing authentication workflows THEN sign-up, sign-in, and password reset SHALL work as expected
3. WHEN testing incomplete onboarding scenarios THEN app access SHALL be properly restricted
4. WHEN testing user data persistence THEN onboarding data SHALL persist across app sessions
5. WHEN authentication failures occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback
6. IF user journey tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear diagnostic information about which step failed

### Requirement 2: Cross-Platform Synchronization Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to sync reliably across devices and platforms, so that I have consistent access to my health information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes on one device THEN it SHALL sync to other devices correctly
2. WHEN simultaneous changes occur on multiple devices THEN conflict resolution SHALL work properly
3. WHEN network failures occur during sync THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully
4. WHEN partial sync failures happen THEN the system SHALL handle them without data corruption
5. WHEN switching between platforms THEN data consistency SHALL be maintained
6. WHEN sync history is tracked THEN it SHALL accurately reflect all synchronization events
7. IF sync operations fail THEN users SHALL receive clear feedback about the issue and resolution steps

### Requirement 3: API Integration and Network Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle network issues gracefully, so that temporary connectivity problems don't disrupt my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API operations encounter network delays THEN they SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
2. WHEN network connectivity is slow THEN authentication SHALL still work correctly
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to users
4. WHEN network recovery occurs THEN pending operations SHALL resume automatically
5. WHEN offline functionality is needed THEN critical features SHALL remain available
6. IF network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and retry options

### Requirement 4: Database Transaction Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database operations to maintain data integrity, so that user data is never corrupted or lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database transactions are executed THEN they SHALL complete atomically
2. WHEN transaction failures occur THEN all changes SHALL be rolled back properly
3. WHEN concurrent database operations happen THEN data consistency SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and handled gracefully
5. WHEN data validation fails THEN transactions SHALL be rejected with clear error messages
6. IF database corruption is detected THEN recovery mechanisms SHALL be triggered

### Requirement 5: Settings Management and Backup Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings to be automatically backed up and restored, so that I don't lose my preferences when switching devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN settings are changed THEN automatic backups SHALL be created
2. WHEN restoring on a new device THEN settings SHALL be properly restored from backup
3. WHEN backup operations fail THEN users SHALL be notified and manual backup options provided
4. WHEN settings conflicts occur THEN resolution mechanisms SHALL work correctly
5. WHEN backup data is corrupted THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL provide default settings
6. IF settings operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain existing settings without corruption

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery Workflows

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully and provide clear guidance, so that I can continue using the app even when problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN appropriate retry mechanisms SHALL be triggered
2. WHEN validation errors happen THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed without retry
3. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN retry limits SHALL be enforced to prevent infinite loops
4. WHEN context-specific errors happen THEN error messages SHALL be tailored to the situation
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN error states SHALL be cleared properly
6. WHEN notification permission errors occur THEN appropriate permission request flows SHALL be triggered
7. WHEN sync errors happen with local fallback THEN local data SHALL be used seamlessly
8. IF error recovery fails THEN users SHALL be provided with manual resolution options

### Requirement 7: Test Reliability and Determinism

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to be reliable and deterministic, so that test failures indicate real issues rather than test infrastructure problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL produce consistent results across multiple executions
2. WHEN tests use mock data THEN mock implementations SHALL behave consistently
3. WHEN tests involve timing THEN they SHALL not be dependent on system performance or timing variations
4. WHEN tests clean up resources THEN they SHALL not interfere with subsequent test executions
5. WHEN tests fail THEN failure messages SHALL clearly indicate the root cause
6. WHEN tests involve async operations THEN proper synchronization SHALL be implemented
7. IF test infrastructure issues occur THEN they SHALL be clearly distinguishable from application bugs

### Requirement 8: Cross-Platform Test Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to work consistently across Android and iOS platforms, so that platform-specific issues can be identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run on Android THEN they SHALL pass with the same behavior as on iOS
2. WHEN platform-specific features are tested THEN appropriate platform mocks SHALL be used
3. WHEN cross-platform data flows are tested THEN consistency SHALL be validated
4. WHEN platform differences exist THEN tests SHALL account for legitimate platform variations
5. WHEN CI/CD runs tests THEN they SHALL work reliably in automated environments
6. IF platform-specific failures occur THEN they SHALL be clearly identified and documented
