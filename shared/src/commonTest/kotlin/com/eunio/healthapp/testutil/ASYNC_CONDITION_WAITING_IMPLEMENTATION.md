# Async Condition Waiting Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of enhanced async condition waiting mechanisms for integration tests, addressing task 9.2 from the integration test fixes specification.

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 7.2**: WHEN tests use mock data THEN mock implementations SHALL behave consistently
- **Requirement 7.6**: WHEN tests involve async operations THEN proper synchronization SHALL be implemented

## Implementation Components

### 1. AsyncConditionWaiter Class

**Location**: `shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/testutil/AsyncConditionWaiter.kt`

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive condition waiting with timeout and error handling
- Eventual consistency checking for async operations
- Polling mechanisms with adaptive intervals
- Clear error messages with diagnostic information
- Support for multiple condition types (all, any, state change, value matching)

**Core Methods**:
- `waitForCondition()` - Basic condition waiting with timeout
- `waitForEventualConsistency()` - Ensures condition remains stable for a duration
- `waitForAllConditions()` - Waits for multiple conditions to all be true
- `waitForAnyCondition()` - Waits for any of multiple conditions to be true
- `waitForStateChange()` - Detects when state changes from initial value
- `waitForValue()` - Waits for specific target value
- `waitForValueInRange()` - Waits for numeric value within range
- `executeAndWaitForEffect()` - Executes operation and waits for effects

### 2. BaseIntegrationTest Enhancements

**Location**: `shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/testutil/BaseIntegrationTest.kt`

**Enhancements**:
- Integrated AsyncConditionWaiter into base test class
- Added convenience methods for common async waiting patterns
- Enhanced diagnostic information collection
- Improved error handling with context information

**New Methods**:
- `waitForConditionEnhanced()` - Enhanced condition waiting with diagnostics
- `waitForEventualConsistency()` - Eventual consistency checking
- `waitForAllConditions()` - Multiple condition waiting
- `waitForAnyCondition()` - Any condition waiting
- `waitForStateChange()` - State change detection
- `waitForValue()` - Value matching
- `waitForValueInRange()` - Range checking
- `executeAndWaitForEffect()` - Operation with effect waiting
- `waitForAsyncOperationEnhanced()` - Enhanced async operation waiting
- `waitForMockServiceState()` - Mock service state monitoring
- `getAsyncDiagnostics()` - Comprehensive diagnostic information

### 3. Configuration and Customization

**WaitConfiguration**:
- Configurable timeouts and polling intervals
- Adaptive polling with exponential backoff
- Detailed logging and diagnostics
- Error handling strategies

**ConditionContext**:
- Provides context information to condition functions
- Includes attempt count, elapsed time, remaining time
- Enables context-aware condition evaluation

### 4. Error Handling and Diagnostics

**WaitResult Types**:
- `Success` - Condition met successfully
- `Timeout` - Condition not met within timeout
- `Error` - Exception occurred during waiting

**Diagnostic Features**:
- Detailed error messages with context
- Mock service state information
- Timing and attempt information
- Full execution logs

## Usage Examples

### Basic Condition Waiting
```kotlin
waitForConditionEnhanced(
    condition = { someAsyncOperation.isComplete() },
    timeout = 5.seconds,
    errorMessage = "Operation did not complete"
)
```

### Eventual Consistency
```kotlin
waitForEventualConsistency(
    condition = { dataIsConsistent() },
    stabilityDuration = 500.milliseconds,
    timeout = 10.seconds
)
```

### Multiple Conditions
```kotlin
waitForAllConditions(
    conditions = listOf(
        "service_ready" to { service.isReady() },
        "data_loaded" to { data.isLoaded() },
        "user_authenticated" to { auth.isAuthenticated() }
    ),
    timeout = 10.seconds
)
```

### State Change Detection
```kotlin
waitForStateChange(
    stateProvider = { repository.getCount() },
    initialState = 0,
    timeout = 5.seconds
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Test Reliability**: Eliminates timing-dependent test failures
2. **Better Error Messages**: Clear diagnostic information when tests fail
3. **Flexible Waiting Strategies**: Multiple condition types and patterns
4. **Eventual Consistency**: Proper handling of async operations
5. **Adaptive Polling**: Efficient resource usage with smart polling intervals
6. **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Full context for debugging test failures

## Integration with Existing Tests

The implementation is fully integrated with the existing test infrastructure:
- Available in all classes extending `BaseIntegrationTest`
- Compatible with existing timing management
- Works with mock services and test utilities
- Provides backward compatibility with existing test patterns

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite validates all functionality:
- **AsyncConditionWaiterTest**: Tests core waiting mechanisms
- **AsyncConditionWaitingExampleTest**: Demonstrates practical usage
- Integration with existing test infrastructure verified

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Custom condition builders for common patterns
- Integration with test reporting systems
- Performance metrics and optimization
- Additional condition types and patterns
- Cross-platform consistency validation

## Conclusion

The async condition waiting implementation successfully addresses the requirements for reliable, deterministic integration tests. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for handling async operations, eventual consistency, and complex condition scenarios while maintaining clear error reporting and diagnostic capabilities.
