    runOptimizedTest("my-test") {
        // Create optimized test data
        val user = createOptimizedUser("test-user")
        val logs = createTestDataBatch(user.id, logCount = 10)
        
        // Test logic here
        assertNotNull(user)
        assertTrue(logs.dailyLogs.size == 10)

        val log = scope.createDailyLog(user.id)
        val cycle = scope.createCycle(user.id)
        
        // Test logic here
        assertNotNull(user)
