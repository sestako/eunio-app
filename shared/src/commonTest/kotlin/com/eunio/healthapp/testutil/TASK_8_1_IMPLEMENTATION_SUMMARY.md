## Usage Examples

### Fast Unit Test
```kotlin
class MyFastTest : FastUnitTest() {
    @Test
    fun myQuickTest() {
        val user = createCachedTestUser()
        // Test logic - completes in < 100ms
    }
}
```

### Parallel Test Execution
```kotlin
val testOperations = listOf(
    "test1" to suspend { /* test logic */ },
    "test2" to suspend { /* test logic */ }
)

val result = SimpleParallelTestExecutor.executeWithMonitoring(
    operations = testOperations,
    maxConcurrency = 4
)
```

### Performance Monitoring
```kotlin
val monitor = TestSuitePerformanceMonitor.getInstance()
monitor.startSuite()

monitor.monitorTest("my_test") {
    // Test logic
}

val report = monitor.endSuite()
report.printReport() // Shows compliance with 5-minute limit
```
