- Validates service integration with business logic
- Ensures services can perform their intended functions

#### Platform-Specific Feature Testing
- **Android**: Tests SharedPreferences, Context integration, notification system
- **iOS**: Tests NSUserDefaults, UNUserNotificationCenter integration
- Validates platform-specific optimizations and integrations

#### Error Handling Validation
- Ensures services handle errors gracefully without crashing
- Validates fallback mechanisms work correctly
- Tests service recovery and resilience

#### Performance Testing
- Measures service operation execution times
- Validates performance is within acceptable thresholds
- Compares performance characteristics across platforms

### 4. Key Features

#### Comprehensive Reporting
- Detailed validation reports with success/failure metrics
- Platform-specific test results and analysis
- Cross-platform consistency validation results
- Performance benchmarking and comparison

#### Flexible Platform Detection
- Automatic platform detection for appropriate test execution
- Graceful handling when platforms are not available
- Support for testing in various environments (CI/CD, local development)

#### Robust Error Handling
- Tests continue even when individual services fail
- Detailed error reporting and diagnostics
- Fallback testing scenarios for service failures

#### Integration with Existing Infrastructure
- Uses existing Koin dependency injection setup
- Integrates with current service implementations
