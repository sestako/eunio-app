# Method Overload Resolution Summary

## Task 5.2: Resolve conflicting method overloads

### Issues Identified and Resolved

#### 1. Method Organization and Consistency
**Problem**: Mock implementations had inconsistent method organization and potential ambiguity in method signatures.

**Solution**: Reorganized and improved the following mock implementations:

##### MockSettingsRepositoryForUpdate
- **Before**: Had duplicate method definitions with inconsistent ordering
- **After**: Organized methods logically with clear comments grouping related functionality
- **Improvement**: Removed potential ambiguity by ensuring consistent method signatures

##### MockSettingsRepository (SyncPreferencesViewModelTest)
- **Before**: All methods were in a single block without organization
- **After**: Grouped methods by functionality:
  - Core settings methods
  - Sync methods  
  - Conflict resolution and backup methods
  - Utility methods
  - Observation methods

##### MockSettingsRepositoryForGet
- **Before**: Basic implementation without clear organization
- **After**: Added clear comments for method grouping and consistent implementation

##### MockSettingsRepository (SettingsRepositoryTest)
- **Before**: Basic implementation
- **After**: Added clear comments for method organization

#### 2. Method Signature Consistency
**Problem**: Potential inconsistencies in method signatures across different mock implementations.

**Solution**: 
- Ensured all `getUserSettings()` overloads are properly implemented
- Maintained consistent return types across all mock implementations
- Verified that both `getUserSettings(): Result<UserSettings?>` and `getUserSettings(userId: String): Result<UserSettings?>` are correctly implemented

#### 3. Access Modifier Consistency
**Problem**: Potential inconsistencies in method visibility and access modifiers.

**Solution**:
- Verified all override methods use consistent access modifiers
- Ensured no conflicting visibility declarations
- Maintained proper encapsulation with private fields where appropriate

### Verification Results

#### Compilation Success
- ✅ All test files compile successfully
- ✅ No method overload conflicts detected
- ✅ No ambiguous method resolution errors
- ✅ All mock implementations properly implement their interfaces

#### Test Execution
- ✅ UpdateDisplayPreferencesUseCaseTest runs successfully
- ✅ All related tests continue to pass
- ✅ No runtime method resolution issues

### Technical Improvements Made

1. **Method Grouping**: Organized methods by functionality for better readability
2. **Comment Clarity**: Added clear comments to indicate method groupings
3. **Consistent Implementation**: Ensured all getUserSettings overloads have consistent behavior
4. **Code Organization**: Improved overall structure of mock implementations

### Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Mock services properly implement their interfaces
- ✅ **Requirement 3.3**: Interface compatibility maintained across all implementations
- ✅ Fixed getUserSettings() overload conflicts in MockSettingsRepositoryForUpdate
- ✅ Removed duplicate method definitions causing compilation ambiguity
- ✅ Ensured consistent method signatures across all mock implementations
- ✅ Updated method visibility and access modifiers as needed

### Files Modified

4. `shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/domain/repository/SettingsRepositoryTest.kt`

### Impact

- **Improved Code Quality**: Better organized and more maintainable mock implementations
- **Enhanced Readability**: Clear method grouping makes code easier to understand
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Eliminated potential method resolution conflicts
- **Better Consistency**: Uniform approach across all mock implementations

### Conclusion

Task 5.2 has been successfully completed. All method overload conflicts have been resolved, and mock implementations now follow consistent patterns with improved organization and clarity. The changes maintain full backward compatibility while enhancing code quality and maintainability.
