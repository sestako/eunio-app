# Quick Logcat Fix - No Logs Visible

## What I Just Did

I added test logs to your app to help diagnose why you're not seeing logs in Logcat.

### Changes Made:

1. **MainActivity** - Added test logs that will appear when the app starts
2. **Service Init Logs** - Added initialization logs to all services

## Next Steps - Follow These in Order:

### Step 1: Rebuild and Run the App

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean
./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug
```

Or in Android Studio:
- **Build → Clean Project**
- **Build → Rebuild Project**
- **Run the app** (Shift+F10)

### Step 2: Check Logcat Configuration

In the Logcat panel (bottom of Android Studio):

1. **Check the dropdown at the top** - Make sure it shows your app process:
   - Should say something like: `com.eunio.healthapp` or `Pixel 9 (emulator-5554)`
   - If it says "No debuggable processes", the app isn't running

2. **Set Log Level to "Verbose"**:
   - Look for a dropdown that says "Verbose", "Debug", "Info", etc.
   - Set it to **"Verbose"**

3. **Clear the search box**:
   - Remove any text from the filter/search box at the top
   - Click the trash icon to clear old logs

### Step 3: Look for Test Logs

After running the app, search for: `MainActivity`

You should see these logs:
```
V/MainActivity: ========================================
V/MainActivity: MainActivity onCreate - App Starting
D/MainActivity: DEBUG: Logging system is working!
I/MainActivity: INFO: App initialized successfully
W/MainActivity: WARN: This is a test warning
E/MainActivity: ERROR: This is a test error (not a real error)
V/MainActivity: ========================================
D/MainActivity: Setting up UI content...
```

## Troubleshooting Results:

### ✅ If You See the MainActivity Logs:
**Good news!** Logging is working. The issue is that your services aren't being called yet.

**Why?** The services only log when they're actually used. You need to:
- Create a daily log entry
- Update your profile
- Sign in/out
- Navigate between screens

The services might not be wired up to the UI yet, so they're never instantiated.

### ❌ If You DON'T See the MainActivity Logs:

There's a Logcat configuration issue. Try these:

#### Option 1: Check from Command Line
```bash
# Clear logs
adb logcat -c

# View logs
adb logcat | grep MainActivity
```

If you see logs in the terminal but not in Android Studio:
- Restart Android Studio
- **File → Invalidate Caches / Restart**

#### Option 2: Check Build Variant
1. **View → Tool Windows → Build Variants**
2. Make sure it's set to **"debug"** (not "release")
3. If it was "release", change to "debug" and rebuild

#### Option 3: Check Device Connection
```bash
adb devices
```

Should show:
```
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device
```

If no devices:
- Reconnect device
- Restart emulator
- `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

#### Option 4: Restart Everything
1. Stop the app
2. Close Android Studio
3. Kill ADB: `adb kill-server`
4. Restart Android Studio
5. Start ADB: `adb start-server`
6. Run the app again

## Common Issues and Solutions:

### Issue: "No debuggable processes"
**Solution**: The app isn't running. Check the Run panel for errors.

### Issue: Logcat shows logs from other apps
**Solution**: Select your app in the device/process dropdown

### Issue: Only seeing ERROR logs
**Solution**: Change log level from "Error" to "Verbose"

### Issue: Logcat panel is empty/frozen
**Solution**: 
- Close and reopen Logcat panel: **View → Tool Windows → Logcat**
- Or use command line: `adb logcat`

## What to Report Back:

Please let me know:

1. **Do you see the MainActivity test logs?** (Yes/No)
2. **What does the device/process dropdown show?**
3. **What is the log level set to?** (Verbose/Debug/Info/etc.)
4. **Can you see logs from command line?** (`adb logcat | grep MainActivity`)

This will help me figure out exactly what's wrong!

## Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Rebuilt the app (Clean + Rebuild)
- [ ] App is running (not crashed)
- [ ] Correct app selected in Logcat dropdown
- [ ] Log level set to "Verbose"
- [ ] Search box is empty (no filters)
- [ ] Tried `adb logcat` from command line
- [ ] Checked Build Variant is "debug"

Once we see the MainActivity logs, we'll know logging works and can focus on why the services aren't being called.
