4. **CRITICAL**: No core health tracking functionality works
5. **HIGH**: Users cannot accomplish any primary app objectives

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Priority 1**: Implement basic health data input and persistence
2. **Priority 2**: Connect authentication system to enable user accounts
3. **Priority 3**: Replace mock data with real user data integration
4. **Priority 4**: Make settings screen interactive and functional
5. **Priority 5**: Implement at least one complete end-to-end user workflow

**Estimated Effort to Achieve Minimum Viable User Experience**: 20-30 days (HIGH effort)

## User Experience Recommendations

### Short-term (1-2 weeks):
1. Fix dependency injection to enable basic functionality
2. Implement simple health data logging with local storage
3. Make settings screen interactive with basic preferences

### Medium-term (3-4 weeks):
1. Implement user authentication and account management
2. Replace mock data with real user data throughout app
3. Add data export functionality

### Long-term (5-8 weeks):
1. Implement advanced cycle tracking and predictions
2. Add comprehensive notification system
3. Enhance accessibility and user experience polish

**Current State**: The app has excellent UI design and architecture but provides zero functional value to users. It's essentially a sophisticated demo with no working features.
