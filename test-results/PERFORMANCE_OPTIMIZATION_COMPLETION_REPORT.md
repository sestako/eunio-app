## Usage Examples

### Basic Performance-Optimized Test
```kotlin
@Test
fun testWithPerformanceOptimization() = runTest {
    runOptimizedTest("my-test") { context ->
        val user = createOptimizedUser("test-user")
        val logs = createTestDataBatch(user.id, logCount = 10)
        
        assertNotNull(user)
        assertTrue(logs.dailyLogs.size == 10)
        
        context.setResult("Test completed successfully")
    }
}
```

### Resource Scoped Test
```kotlin
@Test
fun testWithResourceScoping() = runTest {
    withResourceScope { scope ->
        val user = scope.createUser("scoped-user")
        val log = scope.createDailyLog(user.id)
        val cycle = scope.createCycle(user.id)
        
        // Test logic here - resources automatically cleaned up
    }
}
```
