## 🚀 What You Need to Know

A splash screen now appears when you launch the app, showing initialization progress in real-time.

## ✅ It's Already Working!

The splash screen is **already integrated** and will appear automatically when you:
- Launch the app for the first time
- Cold start the app
- Restart the app

## 📱 What You'll See

1. **Beautiful gradient background** (animated blue theme)
2. **App logo** (❤️ Eunio Health)
3. **Real-time initialization log** showing:
   - ✅ Kotlin Runtime
   - ✅ Dependency Injection
   - ✅ Firebase Authentication
   - ✅ Cloud Firestore
   - ✅ Local Database
   - ✅ Network Status
   - ✅ App Configuration

4. **Smooth transition** to the main app (~3 seconds)
