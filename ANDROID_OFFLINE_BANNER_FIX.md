# Android Offline Banner Missing on Daily Log Screen - FIXED ✅

## Issue Summary
The offline banner ("You're offline. Changes will sync when connected.") appears on the home screen but not on the Daily Log screen. This creates an inconsistent user experience where users may not realize they're offline when entering data.

## Root Cause
The `DailyLoggingScreen` component was not including the `OfflineBanner` component, while the `MainScreen` was. This was an oversight in the UI implementation.

## Solution Implemented

### Added OfflineBanner to DailyLoggingScreen

**File**: `androidApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/android/ui/logging/DailyLoggingScreen.kt`

**Change**:
```kotlin
) { paddingValues ->
    Column(
        modifier = modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .padding(paddingValues)
    ) {
        // Offline banner - ADDED
        OfflineBanner()
        
        // Date picker section
        AccessibleDateNavigationSection(
            // ...
        )
    }
}
```

## How It Works

The `OfflineBanner` component:
1. Monitors network connectivity using `NetworkMonitor`
2. Shows a banner when device is offline
3. Hides automatically when connectivity is restored
4. Uses Material 3 design with error container colors
5. Includes an icon and descriptive text

## Behavior After Fix

### When Online
- No banner shown on any screen
- User can save data normally
- Data syncs to Firebase immediately

### When Offline
- **Home Screen**: Shows offline banner ✅
- **Daily Log Screen**: Shows offline banner ✅ (FIXED)
- User can still enter and save data
- Data saves locally and syncs when connectivity restored

## Testing Results

### Compilation
✅ **PASSED** - Code compiles successfully for Android

```bash
./gradlew :androidApp:compileDebugKotlin
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

2. **DailyLoggingScreen** - Fixed ✅

### Screens That May Need It
Consider adding to:

- Insights Screen
- Settings Screen
- Any screen where users can modify data

## Implementation Details

The `OfflineBanner` component is located at:
`androidApp/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/eunio/healthapp/android/ui/components/OfflineBanner.kt`

It uses:
- `NetworkMonitor` from Koin DI
- `collectAsState()` to observe connectivity
- Material 3 `Card` with error container colors
- Icon + Text layout

## Next Steps

### 1. Build and Test
```bash
# Build Android app
./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug

# Install on device
adb install -r androidApp/build/outputs/apk/debug/androidApp-debug.apk
```

### 2. Manual Testing
1. Open app on Android device
2. Navigate to Daily Log screen
3. Enable Airplane Mode
4. Verify banner appears
5. Enter some data and save
6. Disable Airplane Mode
7. Verify banner disappears
8. Verify data syncs to Firebase

### 3. Consider Adding to Other Screens
Review other screens where users can modify data and add the offline banner for consistency.
