# Spec Organization Summary

## What Was Done

Organized all specs in `.kiro/specs/` with clear completion status and priority ordering.

## Completed Specs (8 specs)

Renamed with `-done` suffix:
1. **android-logging-infrastructure-done** - Structured logging implemented
2. **calendar-date-display-fix-done** - Dynamic date display working
3. **critical-infrastructure-fixes-done** - DI and services implemented
4. **enhanced-settings-done** - Full settings system complete
5. **eunio-health-app-done** - Core app structure complete
6. **integration-test-fixes-done** - Integration tests fixed
7. **test-infrastructure-fixes-done** - Test compilation fixed
8. **unit-system-preferences-done** - Unit system preferences complete

## Active Specs (3 specs)

Renamed with priority numbers:

### 1-daily-log-sync-fix (Priority 1 - Highest)
**Status:** ~90% complete  
**Remaining:** Testing and validation (9 tasks)
- Cross-platform sync tests
- Logging verification
- Documentation

**Why Priority 1:** Critical for data sync. Most work done, just needs validation.

### 2-ios-firebase-sync-fix (Priority 2)
**Status:** ~40% complete  
**Remaining:** Testing and implementation (20 tasks)
- iOS Firebase testing
- Cross-platform sync testing
- Remaining operations (cycles, insights, users)
- Offline support
- Production readiness

**Why Priority 2:** Essential for iOS users. Complements daily-log-sync-fix.

### 3-comprehensive-functionality-audit (Priority 3)
**Status:** ~50% complete  
**Remaining:** Assessment and reporting (30+ tasks)
- Complete data/presentation/UX assessments
- Accessibility testing
- Quality analysis
- Generate comprehensive report

**Why Priority 3:** Important for understanding app health, but not blocking. Do after sync fixes.

## Deleted Specs

- **ios-17-modernization** - Obsolete (based on outdated assumptions about Kotlin/Xcode compatibility)

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Complete Priority 1** - Finish daily-log-sync-fix testing
2. **Complete Priority 2** - Get iOS Firebase fully working
3. **Run Priority 3** - Comprehensive audit to identify next priorities
4. **Create new specs** - Based on audit findings

## Benefits

- Clear visibility of what's done vs. in progress
- Priority ordering for active work
- Easy to see completion status at a glance
- Historical specs preserved with -done suffix
